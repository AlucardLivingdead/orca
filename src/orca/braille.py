"""A very experimental approach to the refreshable Braille display.  This
module treats each line of the display as a sequential set of regions, where
each region can potentially backed by an Accessible object.  Depending upon
the Accessible object, the cursor routing keys can be used to perform
operations on the Accessible object, such as invoking default actions or
moving the text caret.

The logical structure maintained by this module is a potentially a very large
2 dimensional text area.  For each line, the text for each region is merely
concatenated together, possibly creating a line that is longer than the
physical display.  In addition, there may be any number of lines.  This module
uses the physical display as a viewport into this large area, and provides
support for the user to press BrlTTY command keys to scroll this viewport to
view all the content.  [[[TODO: WDW - the goal is to support multi-line
displays, but I've only really built in support for a single line display.]]]

As a means to keep things simple for now, regions can only exist on a single
line.  That is, a region cannot cross line boundaries.

The main entry points into this module are as follows:

    o init/shutdown:  for initializing and shutting down this module

    o Line:           a class whose instances maintain an ordered list
                      of Regions

    o Region:         a class whose instances represent an area of text;
                      subclasses of Regions include Component, Text, etc.

    o clear:          clears the logical structure, but keeps the Braille
                      display as is (see refresh)

    o refresh:        repaints the logical structure on the Braille display
                      clipping content based upon the viewport setting
                      
    o addLine:        appends a Line instance to the logical structure

    o setCursor:      sets the position of the cursor (and automatically
                      scrolls the Braille display to show the cursor)

    o setFocus:       utility routine to set the cursor to a region

After initialization, a typical use of this module would be as follows:

    braille.clear()
    line = braille.Line()
    line.addRegion(braille.Region(...))
    line.addRegion(braille.Component(...))
    line.addRegion(braille.Text(...))
    braille.addLine(line)
    braille.setCursor(x,y)
    braille.refresh()

NOTE: for the most part, this module will happily do as requested if it isn't
initialized.  The only impact will be that nothing will be displayed on the
Braille display.
