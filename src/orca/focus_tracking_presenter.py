"""Provides the focus tracking presentation manager for Orca.  The main
entry points into this module are for the presentation manager contract:

    processObjectEvent  - handles all object events
    processKeyEvent     - handles all keyboard events
    processBrailleEvent - handles all Braille input events
    activate            - called when this manager is enabled
    deactivate          - called when this manager is disabled

This module uses the script module to maintain a set of scripts for all
running applications, and also keeps the notion of an activeScript.  All
object events are passed to the associated script for that application,
regardless if the application has keyboard focus or not.  All keyboard events
are passed to the active script only if it has indicated interest in the
event.
