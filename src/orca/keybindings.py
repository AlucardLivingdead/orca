    """Converts an XKeysym string (e.g., 'KP_Enter') to a keycode that
    should match the event.hw_code for key events.

    This whole situation is caused by the fact that Solaris chooses
    to give us different keycodes for the same key, and the keypad
    is the primary place where this happens: if NumLock is not on,
    there is no telling the difference between keypad keys and the
    other navigation keys (e.g., arrows, page up/down, etc.).  One,
    for example, would expect to get KP_End for the '1' key on the
    keypad if NumLock were not on.  Instead, we get 'End' and the
    keycode for it matches the keycode for the other 'End' key.  Odd.
    If NumLock is on, we at least get KP_* keys.

    So...when setting up keybindings, we say we're interested in
    KeySyms, but those keysyms are carefully chosen so as to result
    in a keycode that matches the actual key on the keyboard.  This
    is why we use KP_1 instead of KP_End and so on in our keybindings.

    Arguments:
    - keysym: a string that is a valid representation of an XKeysym.

    Returns an integer representing a key code that should match the
    event.hw_code for key events.
