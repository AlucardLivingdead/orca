"""Each script maintains a set of key bindings, braille bindings, and AT-SPI
event listeners.  The key bindings are a dictionary where the keys are
keystrings and the values are instances of InputEventHandler.  The braille
bindings are also a dictionary where the keys are BrlTTY command integers and
the values are instances of InputEventHandler.  The listeners field is a
dictionary where the keys are AT-SPI event names and the values are function
pointers.

Instances of scripts are intended to be created solely by the
focus_tracking_presenter, which will call the three main entry points of a
script instance: processObjectEvent, processKeyEvent, and processBrailleEvent.
