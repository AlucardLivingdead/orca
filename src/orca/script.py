"""Each script maintains a set of key bindings, braille bindings, and
AT-SPI event listeners.  The key bindings are an instance of
KeyBindings.  The braille bindings are also a dictionary where the
keys are BrlTTY command integers and the values are instances of
InputEventHandler.  The listeners field is a dictionary where the keys
are AT-SPI event names and the values are function pointers.

Instances of scripts are intended to be created solely by the
focus_tracking_presenter, which will call the main entry points of a
script instance: processObjectEvent, processKeyboardEvent, and
processBrailleEvent, locusOfFocusChanged, and visualAppearanceChanged.

This Script class is not intended to be instantiated directly.
Instead, it is expected that subclasses of the Script class will be
created in their own module.  The module defining the Script subclass
is also required to have a 'getScript(app)' method that returns an
instance of the Script subclass.  See default.py for an example."""

        This method should not be called by anyone except the
        focus_tracking_presenter.  The main responsibilities of
        this constructor are as follows:

          1) Set the app field of the instance to the app object that
             was passed in.  It is OK to have a None app.

          2) Set the name field of the instance to a meaningful name
             (e.g., the name of the app if app is not None).  This
             name field is useful primarily for debugging purposes.

          3) Set up with listeners field, which is a dictionary where
             the keys are AT-SPI event type strings (e.g., 'focus:')
             and the values are methods whose parameters are
             (self,event).

          4) Set up the braillebindings field, which is a dictionary
             where the keys are BrlTTY commands (e.g.,
             braille.CMD_FWINLT]) and the values are InputEventHandler
             instances (see input_event.py).

          5) Set up the keybindings field, which is an instance of
             a KeyBindings class (see keybindings.py).  Scripts will
             add keybindings to the keybindings field by using its
             'add' method to add an instance of a KeyBinding (see also
             keybindings.py).
