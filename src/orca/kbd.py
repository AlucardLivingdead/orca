"""Provides support for registering and handling keyboard events.
All keyboard events are chanelled through KeyStrokeListener instances.
These instances maintain a function pointer to call when their
notifyEvent method is called by the at-spi registry.  This function
is expected to handle the keyboard event and return True if they
have consumed the event.

For the purposes of Orca, the main entry points to this module are:

    init:     registers a bazillion listeners with AT-SPI and funnels
              them all through a single listener.
              
    shutdown: unregisters all the listeners.
