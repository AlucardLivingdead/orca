"""Provides support for registering and handling keyboard events.
All keyboard events are chanelled through KeyStrokeListener instances.
These instances maintain a function pointer to call when their
notifyEvent method is called by the at-spi registry.  This function
is expected to handle the keyboard event and return True if they
have consumed the event.

For the purposes of orca, this module provides an onKeyEvent function
that serves as the sole function pointer for all KeyStrokeListener
instances.  This module also maintains a dictionary named
"keybindings" that provides a mapping from a keyboard event to a
function pointer.  Orca will replace the "keybindings" dictionary
with the keybindings from a script when the script becomes active.

This modules also maintains a "lastKey" attribute which is a string
that describes the last key event typed by the user.  This is sometimes
used by scripts to determine what keyboard actions may have caused an
at-spi event.
