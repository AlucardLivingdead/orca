# This script is meant to repeatedly play a keystrokes file to provide
# a hands-off method for exercising Orca.  It is used primarily to
# stress Orca and help flush out stability/reliability problems.

#
# The keystrokes file is passed in as the sole argument to this
# script, and this script will continue to play the keystrokes until
# it detects that Orca is no longer running.
