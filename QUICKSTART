I. BRAILLE:
-----------

Orca uses BrlTTY to provide access to braille displays.  One of the
main reasons for this is that helps Orca cooperate well in an
environment where a user switches between a graphical and
non-graphical environment.

Orca has been tested with versions 3.6.2 and 3.7.0 of BrlTTY.  You can
obtain BrlTTY from http://www.mielke.cc/brltty/.  Here are typical
commands you will execute to build/install BrlTTY (you might need to
download compilers and other essential build tools for your platform
first):

tar xzf brltty-3.7.tar.gz
cd brltty-3.7
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

Follow the documentation at http://www.mielke.cc/brltty/ for more
information on building, installing, and running BrlTTY.


II. SPEECH:
-----------

Orca uses gnome-speech to provide speech output.  Gnome-speech is a
separate GNOME module that provides a service oriented architecture to
access speech synthesis engines as system services.  Gnome-speech
provides support for a number of speech synthesis engines, including
freely available ones: festival and FreeTTS.

FreeTTS can be obtained from http://freetts.sourceforge.net/, and
requires the Java platform.  Festival ships with Fedora Core 4 by 
default, and can be obtained for Unbuntu 5.10 by performing the
following command:

   sudo apt-get install festival

The gnome-speech module contains information on setting up
gnome-speech for the various synthesis engines.  To obtain the latest
gnome-speech source code, one can perform the following steps:

cd $HOME
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co gnome-speech
cd gnome-speech

NOTE: before running Orca, one should make sure gnome-speech is
actually working before assuming there is a problem with Orca.  To
test gnome-speech, one can run its "test-speech" application; it will
provide you with the ability to view and hear the various speech
synthesis engines that gnome-speech knows about on your system.


III. ORCA ON UBUNTU 5.10:
-------------------------

1) Install from CD.

2) Get Necessary Packages

   sudo apt-get install emacs21

   sudo apt-get install build-essential cvs \
        autoconf automake1.4 automake1.7 automake1.9 \
        docbook docbook-utils docbook-xsl \
        docbook2x doxygen bison flex libpopt-dev jade \
   	libtool intltool pkg-config gtk-doc-tools \
   	x-dev x-window-system-dev \
   	libgnome2-dev libbonobo-activation-dev \
   	libgnomecanvas2-dev \
	python-dev python-gnome2-dev python-gtk2-dev

3) Checkout/build/install ATK, GAIL, AT-SPI

   cd $HOME
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co atk
   cd atk
   ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
   make
   sudo make install

   cd $HOME
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co gail
   cd gail
   ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
   make
   sudo make install

   cd $HOME
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co at-spi
   cd at-spi
   ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
   make
   sudo make install

5) GOTO SECTION: "ORCA ON LINUX DISTRIBUTION"


IV. ORCA ON FEDORA CORE 4:
-------------------------

1) Do an "everything" install of Fedora Core 4.
   [[[WDW - need to determine exact dependencies.]]]

2) Checkout/build/install the "gnome-common" module from cvs.gnome.org

   cd $HOME
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co gnome-common
   cd gnome-common
   ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
   make
   sudo make install
   
3) GOTO SECTION: "ORCA ON LINUX DISTRIBUTION"


V. ORCA ON LINUX DISTRIBUTION:
------------------------------

1) Run /usr/bin/test-speech to make sure it works.  If it doesn't,
   this is a gnome-speech problem.  Refer to the "SPEECH" section
   for more information on gnome-speech.

2) Checkout/build/install Orca

   cd $HOME
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co orca
   cd orca
   ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
   make
   sudo make install

3) Run /usr/bin/orca-setup.

4) Log out and log back in to make the accessibility property take effect.

5) Run /usr/bin/orca


VI. WRITING SCRIPTS:
--------------------

Orca is a scriptable screen reader, permitting you to write your own
custom scripts to provide custom interaction with individual
applications.

[[[WDW: point to script writing guide (it's in source form in the 
Orca module under docs/doc-set/script_guide.sgml and is currently
under development).]]]

[[[WDW: work on a way for people to contribute their scripts back to
the community.  Perhaps via patches to the orca module, perhaps via
a web site, perhaps via a mailing list, etc.]]]


VII. KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--------------------

1) Doesn't work on a 64-bit architecture.  Unsure why at this point,
   but you will get the following error:

   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "/usr/bin/orca-setup", line 64, in ?
       import orca.speech as speech
     File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/orca/speech.py", line 29, in ?
       from core import ORBit, bonobo
   ImportError: No module named core

2) test-speech will often fail when you attempt to use the festival
   speech synthesis engine:

   % /usr/bin/test-speech
   1: OAFIID:GNOME_Speech_SynthesisDriver_Festival:proto0.3

   Select a server: 1
   Attempting to activate OAFIID:GNOME_Speech_SynthesisDriver_Festival:proto0.3.
   Server could not be initialized.

   You can fix this by making sure "localhost" is listed before
   "localhost.localdomain" in the 127.0.0.1 line in /etc/hosts.  


VIII. REPORTING BUGS:
---------------------

Report bugs at http://bugzilla.gnome.org under the "orca" module.
Note that Orca is not part of the GNOME 2 desktop yet.  So, when it
comes to selecting the module, you will need to click on the checkbox
that says "Click here to also show applications not part of the GNOME
2 Desktop."  Orca will then be listed as the "orca" module.


IX. CONTRIBUTING:
-----------------

[[[WDW: work on this.  For now, people are encouraged to contribute
bug reports, RFEs, and patches to the orca module via the
http://bugzilla.gnome.org site.]]]


TODO: Need to include the following somewhere:

  * Setting up Java platform and Java Access Bridge
  * Specific use instructions for specific desktop productivity apps.
