#. Translators: this is a regular expression that is intended to match

#. as given means - does it begin with (that's the '^' character) any of
#. the characters in the '[' ']'?  In this case, we've chosen 'Y', 'y', and
#. '1' to mean positive answers, so any string beginning with 'Y', 'y', or
#. '1' will match.  For an example of translation, assume your language has
#. the words 'posolutely' and 'absitively' as common words that mean the
#. equivalent of 'yes'.  You might make the expression match the upper and
#. lower case forms: "^[aApP1]".  If the 'yes' and 'no' words for your
#. locale begin with the same character, the regular expression should be
#. modified to use words.  For example: "^(yes|Yes)" (note the change from
#. using '[' and ']' to '(' and ')').
