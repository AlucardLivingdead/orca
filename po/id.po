Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille 'contractions' get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for 'ing' (dots 3-4-6), and the letter 'e' (dots 1-5) all by itself means 'every'.

#. Translators: this is a structure to assist in the generation of

#. pair is separated by commas.  For example, we see:

#. And so on.  The complete set should consist of all the letters from
#. the alphabet for your language paired with the common
