#. an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h"
#. should not not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are
#. at the bottom of an entry and press Down arrow, should you leave the
#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as something that should be handled by the focused widget.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to manually switch
#. between these two modes.
#: ../src/orca/cmdnames.py:980
msgid "Switches between browse mode and focus mode."
msgstr "Przełącza między trybem przeglądania a trybem zaznaczania."

#. Translators: (Please see the previous, detailed translator notes about
#. Focus mode and Browse mode.) In order to minimize the amount of work Orca
#. users need to do to switch between focus mode and browse mode, Orca attempts
#. to automatically switch to the mode which is appropriate to the current
#. web element. Sometimes, however, this automatic mode switching is not what
#. the user wants. A good example being web apps which have their own keyboard
#. navigation and use interaction model. As a result, Orca has a command which
#. enables setting a "sticky" focus mode which disables all automatic toggling.
#. This string is associated with the Orca command to enable sticky focus mode.

#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read

#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,

#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille 'contractions' get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for 'ing' (dots 3-4-6), and the letter 'e' (dots 1-5) all by itself means 'every'.
