#. should not not move you to the next heading. Similarly, if you are

#. entry? Again, it depends on if you want to resume reading content or
#. if you are editing the text in the entry. Because Orca doesn't know
#. what you want to do, it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats
#. key presses as commands to read the content; in focus mode, Orca treats

#. Translators: Orca has a number of commands that override the default behavior
#. within an application. For instance, on a web page Orca's Structural Navigation
#. command "h" moves you to the next heading. What should happen when you press
#. "h" in an entry on a web page depends: If you want to resume reading content,
#. "h" should move to the next heading; if you want to enter text, "h" should not
#. move you to the next heading. Because Orca doesn't know what you want to do,
#. it has two modes: In browse mode, Orca treats key presses as commands to read
#. the content; in focus mode, Orca treats key presses as something that should be
#. handled by the focused widget. Orca optionally can attempt to detect which mode
#. is appropriate for the current situation and switch automatically. This string
#. is a label for a GUI option to enable such automatic switching when structural
#. navigation commands are used. As an example, if this setting were enabled,
#. pressing "e" to move to the next entry would move focus there and also turn
#. focus mode on so that the next press of "e" would type an "e" into the entry.
#. If this setting is not enabled, the second press of "e" would continue to be

Braille symbols vary from language to language due in part to what print letters exist for that language. The other reason braille symbols vary is due to which braille 'contractions' get used. Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for 'ing' (dots 3-4-6), and the letter 'e' (dots 1-5) all by itself means 'every'. The list of rules which dictate what contractions should be used and whether or not they can be used in a particular context are stored in liblouis' tables.

#. 
#. where the letter and word(s) are separate by colons and each
#. pair is separated by commas.  For example, we see:
