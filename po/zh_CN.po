#. stating that he/she would like to have underlined text announced for all cases
#. (single, double, low, etc.) except when the value of underline is none (i.e.

Contractions are shorter forms of commonly-used letter combinations and words. For instance in English there is a single braille symbol for 'ing' (dots 3-4-6), and the letter 'e' (dots 1-5) all by itself means 'every'.
