      The <gui>keyboard layout</gui> options allow you to specify if
      you will be working on a desktop (i.e. with a numeric keypad)
      or laptop keyboard. Which layout you choose will determine both
      the Orca Modifier key as well as a number of keyboard shortcuts
      for performing <app>Orca</app> commands.</p>

    <title>Disable gksu Keyboard Grab</title>
    <p>
      When running commands from the launch menu, many distributions
      use an application known as gksu to authorize the user to run
      these commands; gksu is the GUI that asks you for your password.
      When it runs, gksu enables what is known as a "keyboard grab,"
      which is a feature to prevent keyboard actions from going to any
      other application on the desktop, including <app>Orca</app>. The
      result of a keyboard grab is that <app>Orca</app> will not receive
      any keyboard events, preventing <app>Orca</app> from functioning
      normally.
    </p>
    <p>
      By checking the "Disable gksu keyboard grab" checkbox, you will
      turn off the keyboard grab behavior, allowing <app>Orca</app> to
      function normally with system administration applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keyboard grab is a security attempt by gksu to prevent nefarious
      applications from "sniffing" the keyboard and grabbing secret
      information. Please be advised that disabling the gksu keyboard grab
      feature can expose you to such nefarious behavior. If you do not feel
      comfortable with this, you can always use the root account for system
      administration purposes. To do so, you need to enable the root account
      for login, and then logout and log back in as root whenever you want to
      perform a system administration command.

    <title>Present Tooltips</title>
    <p>
      When checked, this option will tell <app>Orca</app> to present information
      about tooltips when they appear as the result of mouse hovering. Specific
      actions to force tooltips to appear, such as pressing <keyseq>
      <key>Ctrl</key><key>F1</key></keyseq> when an object has focus, will
      always result in tooltips being presented, regardless of this setting.

      display the <link xref="preferences">Orca Preferences</link> dialog,
      access help content, bring up the About dialog, and quit <app>Orca</app>.
      Many users do not like the <app>Orca</app> main window because it shows
      up in the window manager's Tab order when you press <keyseq>
      <key>Alt</key><key>Tab</key></keyseq> to switch windows. By unchecking
      the "Show <app>Orca</app> main window" checkbox, you can tell
      <app>Orca</app> to not show the <app>Orca</app> main window.
