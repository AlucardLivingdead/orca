  <title>Gecko Navigation Preferences</title>
  <p>
    The following options allow you to customize how <app>Orca</app>
    behaves in Gecko-based applications, including Firefox, Thunderbird,
    and Yelp 2.
  </p>
  <list>
    <item>
      <p>
        <gui>Use <app>Orca</app> Caret Navigation</gui>: This checkbox
        toggles <app>Orca</app>'s caret navigation on and off. It is checked
        by default. To toggle this setting on the fly without saving it, use
        <keyseq><key>Orca Modifier</key><key>F12</key></keyseq>.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        <gui>Grab focus on objects when navigating</gui>: If this checkbox
        is checked, <app>Orca</app> will perform an explicit focus grab as
        you navigate using the <app>Orca</app>-controlled caret. Doing this
        was necessary in older versions of Firefox and Thunderbird. It is
        unchecked by default.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        <gui>Position cursor at start of line when navigating vertically</gui>:
        If this checkbox is checked, <app>Orca</app> will always move the caret
        to the beginning of the line when <app>Orca</app> is controlling the
        caret and you press Up or Down Arrow to read the previous or next line.
        If this checkbox is not checked, <app>Orca</app> will attempt to keep
        the caret in the same horizontal position as you navigate Up or Down.
        It is checked by default.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        <gui>Speak results during find</gui>: If this checkbox is checked,
        <app>Orca</app> will read the line which matches your current search
        query when you are using the application's Find toolbar to perform
        your search. It is checked by default.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        <gui>Only speak changed lines during find</gui>: If this checkbox
        is checked, <app>Orca</app> will not present the matching line if
        it is the same line as the previous match. This option is designed
        to prevent "chattiness" on a line with multiple instances of the
        string for which you are searching. It is unchecked by default.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        <gui>Minimum length of matched text</gui>: The number of characters
        which much match before <app>Orca</app> announces the matching line.
        The default value is four characters.
      </p>
    </item>
  </list>
