  <title>Using Text Setup</title>
  <p>
    Orca has a text setup feature which allows you to perform basic configuration
    of <app>Orca</app> even if the graphical desktop is not running.
  </p>
  <steps>
    <title>Launching <app>Orca</app>'s Text-Only Guided Setup</title>
    <item>
      <p>
        Open a <gui>Run</gui> dialog. For most distros, this can be accomplished
        by pressing <keyseq><key>Alt</key><key>F2</key></keyseq>. Alternatively,
        you can use a terminal window or the system text console.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>
        Type <cmd>orca --text-setup</cmd> or <cmd>orca -t</cmd> and press
       <key>Return</key>.
      </p>
    </item>
  </steps>
  <p>You will be asked a few questions:</p>
  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Select desired speech system</p>
      <p>
        The choices that follow will depend on which speech systems you have
        installed on your system. Type the number associated with your desired
        speech system and press <key>Return</key>.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select desired speech server</p>
      <p>
        The choices that follow will depend on which speech synthesizers you have
        installed on your system. Type the number associated with your desired
        speech server and press <key>Return</key>.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select desired voice</p>
      <p>
        The "voices" correspond with the languages available. In the case of
        speech-dispatcher, there are approximately 60 languages and dialects
        supported with more being added regularly. Type in the number of your
       language choice (e.g., <cmd>7</cmd> for American English) and press
       <key>Return</key>. You do not need to wait for the entire list to be
       spoken. In addition, <app>Orca</app> attempts to make your default
       language the first choice, so in many cases you can simply type
       <cmd>1</cmd> and press <key>Return</key> without having to listen to
       the full list of voices.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Enable echo by word?</p>
      <p>
        This option causes <app>Orca</app> to speak words as you finish typing
        them. Type <cmd>y</cmd> or <cmd>n</cmd> and press <key>Return</key>.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Enable key echo?</p>
      <p>
        This option causes <app>Orca</app> to speak all keys as they are pressed.
        Type <cmd>y</cmd> or <cmd>n</cmd> and press <key>Return</key>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you indicate that you would like key echo enabled, setup will then
        ask you about the types of key echo you can enable or disable. For each
        one, type <cmd>y</cmd> to enable it or <cmd>n</cmd> to disable it and
        press <key>Return</key>. The types are:
      </p>

            should be spoken when pressed.
          </p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>action keys</p>
          <p>
            This option controls whether or not <key>BackSpace</key>,
            <key>Delete</key>, <key>Return</key>, <key>Escape</key>,
            <key>Tab</key>, <key>Page Up</key>, <key>Page Down</key>,
            <key>Home</key>, and <key>End</key> should be spoken when

      <p>Select desired keyboard layout.</p>
      <p>
        Orca has two keyboard layouts: Desktop and Laptop. The layout you
        choose impacts which key is used as the Orca Modifier.
      </p>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>
            If you are using the Laptop layout, the default Orca Modifier will
            be <key>CapsLock</key>
          </p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
            If you are using the Desktop layout, the Orca Modifier will be both
           <key>Insert</key> and <key>KeyPad Insert</key>, the latter being the
           same key as <key>KeyPad 0</key>.
          </p>
        </item>
      </list>
      <p>
        The layout also determines the keystrokes associated with a number of
        <app>Orca</app>'s commands, especially in the areas of Flat Review,
        Where Am I, and Say All.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <cmd>1</cmd> for Desktop layout or <cmd>2</cmd> for Laptop layout
        and press <key>Return</key>.
      </p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Enable Braille</p>
      <p>
        This functionality assumes a BrlTTY-compatible device is available.
        Type <cmd>y</cmd> or <cmd>n</cmd> and press <key>Return</key>. Note
        that you can usually just enter <cmd>y</cmd> here; <app>Orca</app> will
        recover gracefully and function even if it cannot find BrlTTY.
      </p>
    </item>
  </steps>
  <p>
    That's it. <app>Orca</app> is now ready for use and will be launched if
    you are in a graphical desktop environment where accessibility is enabled.
