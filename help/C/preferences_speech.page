          The <gui>Voice settings</gui> combo box makes it possible for
          you to use different voices so that you can better distinguish
          uppercase and linked text from other text, and on-screen text
          from text added by <app>Orca</app>.

          <p>
            For each voice you wish to configure, first select the
            voice in the <gui>Voice settings</gui> combo box. Then
            configure the person, rate, pitch, and volume to be used

          The <gui>Person</gui> combo box allows you to choose which
          "person" or "speaker" should be used with the selected voice.
          For instance, you might wish to have David speak by default,
          but have hyperlinks spoken by Alice. Note that what you find
          in the <gui>Person</gui> combo box will depend on which speech
          synthesizers you have installed.

      The <gui>Verbosity</gui> setting determines the amount of information
      that will be spoken in various situations. For example, if it is set
      to verbose, <app>Orca</app> will speak shortcut keys for items in

      Consider the process of examinging the list of messages in your Inbox.
      In order to have <app>Orca</app> announce the sender, subject, date,
      and presence of attachments you would need <gui>speak row</gui>. On
      the other hand, when navigating amongst rows in a spreadsheet, hearing
      the full row may not be desired. In that case, <gui>speak cell</gui>
      should instead be chosen.

    <title>Progress Bar Updates</title>
    <p>
      If the <gui>Enabled</gui> checkbox is checked <app>Orca</app> will
      periodically announce the status of progress bars. How often the
      announcement is made is determined by the value chosen in the
      <gui>Frequency (secs)</gui> spin button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <gui>Restrict to</gui> combo box allows you to control which
      progress bars should be spoken, assuming the speaking of progress
      bar updates has been enabled. The choices are <gui>All</gui>,
      <gui>Application</gui>, and <gui>Window</gui>. Choosing <gui>All</gui>
      will result in <app>Orca</app> speaking updates for all progress bars,
      regardless of where the progress bars are located. Choosing
      <gui>Application</gui> will result in <app>Orca</app> speaking updates
      from progress bars in the active application, even if they are not in
      the active window. Choosing <gui>Window</gui> will result in
      <app>Orca</app> only speaking updates for progress bars in the active
      window. The default value is <gui>Application</gui>.

    <title>Speak multicase strings as words</title>
    <p>
      In some texts, and especially when working with code, one often comes
      across a "word" consisting of several words with alternating case, such
      as "MultiCaseString." Speech synthesizers do not always pronounce such
      multicase strings correctly. Checking the <gui>Speak multicase strings
      as words</gui> checkbox will cause <app>Orca</app> to break a word like
      "MultiCaseString" into separate words ("Multi," "Case," and "String")
      prior to passing it along to the speech synthesizer.

      Depending on the enabled speech settings, <app>Orca</app> may have quite
      a bit to say about a particular object such as its name, its role, its
      state, its mnemonic, its tutorial message, and so on. Checking the
      <gui>Break speech into chunks between pauses</gui> checkbox will cause
      <app>Orca</app> to insert brief pauses in between each of these pieces
      of information.
