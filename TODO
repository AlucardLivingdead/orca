- Search all modules for "TODO" - there's a lot.  All "TODO" comments
  that have a "HACK" in them usually indicate some odd workaround for
  an apparent AT-SPI implementation oddity.
- Make the kbd module maintain a stack of keypresses, rather than only
  the last individual keypress
- Fix the autogen stuff to better detect package dependencies
- Fix the autogen stuff to better install Orca in the python site-packages
  area if python isn't installed under --prefix.
- Need to handle AT-SPI failures with respect to CORBA (e.g., COMM_FAILURE).
  * Perhaps have a well known "onCommFailure" method in the orca module
    that is called on failures.  This would do the appropriate recovery.
- Implement the style guide for speech and braille.
- Sometimes on Fedora Core 4, when a terminal is started after orca is
  running, the terminal comes up with the "unknown" role.
- Cannot register a callback with FreeTTS driver on Fedora (COMM_FAILURE)
- GEdit will often hang when you quit it while running Orca
  > UPDATE: This is the result of an AT-SPI bug that is awaiting a patch.
- gnome-terminal: "Edit" -> "Current Profile..." -> "Colors"; press the
  color palette button.  The color editing widget is a monster.

- Orca seg faults when it exits.

- When nothing has focus the old stuff on the braille display should go away.
  It should speak and braille no focus.

  When in a text editor such as GEdit doing a find orca should speak the new line landed on.
