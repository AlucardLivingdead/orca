- Make the kbd module maintain a stack of keypresses, rather than only
  the last individual keypress
- Fix the autogen stuff to better detect package dependencies
- Fix the autogen stuff to better install Orca in the python site-packages
  area if python isn't installed under --prefix.
- Need to handle AT-SPI failures with respect to CORBA (e.g., COMM_FAILURE).
  * Perhaps have a well known "onCommFailure" method in the orca module
    that is called on failures.  This would do the appropriate recovery.

- Implement the style guide for speech and braille.
