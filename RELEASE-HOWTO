* What is it ?
==============

Orca is a scriptable screen reader for the GNOME desktop for people
with visual impairments.  It is currently in "pre-alpha" form.  Most
people will *not* want to try orca-0.2.0, but some strong-hearted 
folks with a sense of humor and hacker mentality will relish the 
opportunity to help with the future of Orca.

Source code:

[MD5 sum: 9f12206520311eda477b73e2c07b234c]

Orca 0.2.0 requires: 

	* Python 2.4         - Python platform
	* pyorbit 2.0.0      - Python bindings for ORBit2
	* pygtk 2.4.0        - GTK+ Python bindings
	* gnome-python 2.6.2 - Python bindings for various GNOME libraries
	* gnome-speech 0.3.8 - GNOME speech synthesis services
	* gnome-mag 0.11.14  - GNOME screen magnification services (note 
			       that Orca builds find without gnome-mag,
			       but magnification will not work)
	* BRLTTY 3.6.1       - Braille support (note that Orca builds fine
	                       without BRLTTY installed, but Braille support 
                               will work without it)
	* at-spi 1.6.2       - GNOME assistive technology framework
                               NOTE: need a patch to at-spi/libspi/accessible.c
			       for GEdit and Evolution to work without crashing
			       or hanging.

Enjoy.

Will, Mike, Rich, and the Orca community
