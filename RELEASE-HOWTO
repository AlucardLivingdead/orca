This document provides a step-by-step list to remind Orca
maintainers how to make a release.

The general instructions for a release are here:

  http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/for_maintainers.html

Here's a summary for Orca:

PREPARE SOURCES FOR THE RELEASE:
-------------------------------

Modify these lines in ./configure.in:

  ORCA_MAJOR_VERSION=2
  ORCA_MINOR_VERSION=19
  ORCA_MICRO_VERSION=6

Modify ./README to make sure it has the right Orca version.

Update ./NEWS based upon entries in ./ChangeLog

NOTE: You should also make sure the external dependencies listed in
configure.in and README are accurate.


BUILD THE RELEASE:
-----------------

./autogen.sh && make && make install &&  make distcheck

For sanity, you can run pychecker -- we still have a lot of work to do
to eliminate the lint-ish warnings, but pychecker can help flag some
bad problems we might not have caught during testing:

pychecker -T -# 1000 /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/orca/*.py
pychecker -T -# 1000 /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/orca/scripts/*.py

You should also make the pydoc:

cd docs/pydoc
<edit end of Makefile to uncomment the all: target>
make
<copy resulting *.html to 
 ~/gnome-head/gnomeweb-wml/www.gnome.org/projects/orca/pydoc/
 and check these in.  Also update the associated index.html
 files and such to have latest version and such.  Should also
 do the same thing on http://live.gnome.org/Orca/>


TEST THE CANDIDATE:
------------------

cd /tmp
gunzip -c orca-2.19.6.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd orca-2.19.6
./configure
make
sudo make install
orca


TAG THE RELEASE:
---------------

While in the trunk directory:

svn commit
svn cp . svn+ssh://wwalker@svn.gnome.org/svn/orca/tags/ORCA_2_19_6


UPLOAD THE RELEASE:
------------------

scp orca-2.19.6.tar.gz wwalker@master.gnome.org:
ssh master.gnome.org
install-module orca-2.19.6.tar.gz


IDENTIFY TRUNK AS "PRE":
------------------------

Modify these lines in ./configure.in:

  ORCA_MAJOR_VERSION=2
  ORCA_MINOR_VERSION=19
  ORCA_MICRO_VERSION=90pre

Modify ./README to make sure it has the right "pre" version.


ANNOUNCE THE RELEASE
