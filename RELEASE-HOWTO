Orca is a scriptable screen reader for the GNOME desktop for people
with visual impairments.  It is currently in "pre-alpha" form.  Most
people will *not* want to try orca-0.2.4, but some strong-hearted 
folks with a sense of humor and hacker mentality will relish the 
opportunity to help with the future of Orca.

Will, Mike, Rich, and the Orca community


MAKE AN RPM (IF YOU WANT TO)
----------------------------

See http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/RPM-HOWTO/

Copy orca.spec and tarball to /usr/src/redhat and do it as root,
or make $HOME/.rpmmacros (I never got this to work):

%_topdir: /home/wwalker/work/fedora/gnome-head/orca/rpm-build

rpmbuild -ba orca.spec
