Orca 0.2.1

Introduction
========================================================================

Orca a scriptable screen reader that is currently under development.
As such it is highly unstable and undergoes frequent changes.  To
read more about Orca, please refer to the Orca documentation series
available in the ./docs/doc-set directory.


Build Requirements
========================================================================

Building Orca requires the following to be installed:

	* Python 2.4         - Python platform
	* pyorbit 2.0.0      - Python bindings for ORBit2
	* pygtk 2.4.0        - GTK+ Python bindings
	* gnome-python 2.6.2 - Python bindings for various GNOME libraries
	* gnome-speech 0.3.8 - GNOME speech synthesis services
	* gnome-mag 0.11.14  - GNOME screen magnification services (note 
			       that Orca builds find without gnome-mag,
			       but magnification will not work)
	* BrlTTY 3.6.1       - Braille support (note that Orca builds fine
	                       without BrlTTY installed, but Braille support 
                               will not work without it)
	* at-spi 1.6.2       - GNOME assistive technology framework
                               NOTE: need a patch to at-spi/libspi/accessible.c
			       for GEdit and Evolution to work without crashing
			       or hanging.


Overview
========================================================================

One of the biggest challenges in screen reading technology is
providing a consistent user experience across multiple applications
which may use objects in different ways, and to allow quick access to
information which may not be easily accessible through an
application's keyboard navigation commands.  Orca explores how to
solve some of these difficulties.  Some common scenarios which Orca's
script-based architecture would be suited to solve:

* An application which displays text of interest to the user in a
  non-focusable object

* Create hot keys to be used in certain applications to collect and
  read various pieces of information

* Cause the Braille display to show status information retrieved from
  status bars or other objects in the application

Orca is written in Python and C.  Orca's low-level connection to the
at-spi is a Python module written in C, and the upper-level logic is
entirely written in Python.  Orca defines a set of default behaviors
(reactions to application events) and key bindings (reaction to user
key presses).  These default behaviors and key bindings can be
overwritten on a per-application basis.  Orca creates a script object
for each running application, which merges both the default behaviors
and key bindings, and the application specific ones.  Orca provides
the infrastructure to activate and deactivate scripts, as well as a
host of services accessible from within the scripts.  Some of these
services include:

* A speech module which provides named voices which are definable by
  the user

* A braille module which uses BrlTTY to provide high-level braille services to
  scripts - these services include braille keyboard callback support,
  software-based virtual regions for the braille display, and
  scrolling management

* Convenience functions for finding the labels of objects, getting all the
  objects within a given object, etc.


Initial Setup
========================================================================

Before running orca, you should run orca-setup.  Orca-setup creates a
.orca directory in your home directory.  This directory stores your
user settings, as well as any scripts which you use that are not part
of the default Orca installation.
