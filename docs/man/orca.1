Orca is a screen reader for people with visual impairments,
and provides alternative access to the desktop by making use
of speech synthesis, braille, and magnification  support on
the platform\&.
.PP
In addition, orca only provides access to
applications/toolkits that support the assistive technology
service provide interface (AT-SPI), which include GTK,
Mozilla, Firefox, Evolution, OpenOffice, StarOffice,
Java/Swing, etc\&.

In order for this "Accessible GNOME Desktop" to be accessible
to users who are blind or have low vision, users will need to 
employ an assistive technology (AT) that exposes the graphical
desktop information encoded in the GNOME Accessibility Framework\&.
.PP
Customers with blind employees/students need to have the ability
to adapt and customize their assistive technology solutions - both 
to improve the efficiency of their blind users (to help make up for
disadvantages inherent in not being able to "see" the entire screen
immediately at a glace), and also to "work around" poorly designed 
and not particularly accessible applications that their blind users
need to use\&.
.PP
orca is an extensible assistive technology that provides end-user
access to applications and toolkits that support the GNOME 
Accessibility Framework\&. It has been designed with direct continual
feedback from its disability user community\&.
.PP
orca uses a "scripting" approach to easily allow  customization
per application and provides the ability for each user to further 
customize their AT environment based on their own preferences\&.
The "scripting" approach of orca provides a much more adaptable
and compelling assistive technology solution than existing AT 
for the JDS desktop\&.
.PP
Functionally orca has to do 4 major things:
.br
.sp
1.
.mk
.in +4
.rt
Present information to the user via speech synthesis
(text-to-speech), or refreshable braille (hardware connected
to serial or USB port), or a magnified image on the user\&'s display\&.
.sp
.in -4
.br
.sp
2.
.mk
.in +4
.rt
Acquire information from the applications and desktop
graphical display via the GNOME Accessibility Framework\&.
.sp
.in -4
.br
.sp
3.
.mk
.in +4
.rt
Track events occurring in the applications and desktop
graphical display via the GNOME Accessibility Framework\&.
.sp
.in -4
.br
.sp
4.
.mk
.in +4
.rt
Intercept and optionally consume user input events from
the system keyboard and the buttons on a refreshable braille
display\&. Based on the input, orca will either pass the
event on to the application for normal processing, execute
Orca-specific commands (such as reading the next line in the
display or panning the braille display), or perform operations 
on application objects (such as clicking buttons or modifying text areas)\&.
.sp
.in -4
.PP
orca will also:
.sp
.in +2
\(bu
.mk
.in +3
.rt
be a collection of building blocks that comprise screen reading and 
magnification technology, including use of text-to-speech, braille
input/output, magnification logic, screen reading logic, keyboard 
and mouse interception modules, and event coalescing\&.
.sp

\(bu

Accessibility Framework and other supported X mechanisms\&.
.sp

support the gnome-mag module to provide end-user magnification
of the screen between 2 and 16 times magnification in integer increments\&.

Orca provides a set of its own keyboard commands\&. 
Note that you can always enter Orca\&'s "learn mode" while running Orca by 
pressing Insert+F1\&. When in learn mode, Orca will intercept all keyboard 
and braille input events and will tell you what the effect of them would 
be\&. To exit learn mode, press the escape key\&.

Note: the above commands apply when working with objects as well as when 
working with text\&. For example, if the flat review cursor were positioned 
on a menu bar, pressing the read current line command would speak the 
names of all visible menus\&. Similarly, pressing read next word would 
speak the object to the right of the flat review cursor on the same line, 
or move flat review to the next line if no more objects were found\&.
