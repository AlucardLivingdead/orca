  <chapter id="architecture"><title>Architecture</title>

    <para>The Orca architecture has been driven primarily by the Orca
      User Experience Design.  There are two primary operating modes
      of Orca: a focus tracking mode and a flat review mode.</para>

    <para>The focus tracking mode generally relies upon applications
      to provide reasonable keyboard navigation techniques to allow
      the user to operate the application without requiring the mouse.
      As the user uses traditional keyboard navigation techniques to
      move from component to component in the application (e.g.,
      pressing the Tab key to move from pushbutton to text area to
      toggle button, etc.), Orca will present this to the user via
      braille, speech, magnification, or a combination thereof.  In
      the cases where more complex navigation is needed, such as
      structural navigation of complex text documents, Orca also
      provides a facility to define keyboard and braille input events
      that it can intercept and handle appropriately.</para>

    <para>The flat review mode provides the user with the ability to
      spatially navigate a window, giving them the ability to explore
      as well as discover and interact with components in the window.
      Orca provides a default set of keybindings for flat review, and
      these keybindings can be easily redefined by the user.</para>

    <para>The various modes of Orca are handled by "scripts," which
      are Python modules that can provide a custom interpretation of
      an application's interaction model.  It is not intended that 
      there will be a unique script for every application.  Instead,
      it is expected that there will be a general purpose script that
      covers a large number of applications.  In the event that more
      compelling or custom behavior is desired for an application,
      however, one can use a custom script for the application.
      Furthermore, scripts can subclass other scripts, allowing
      them to be quite simple.</para>

    <para>As illustrated in the high level Orca architecture diagram,
      the main components of Orca are as follows: desktop applications
      that support the AT-SPI, the AT-SPI registry and infrastructure,
      Orca itself, Orca Scripts, and system services (e.g., speech,
      braille, magnification).</para>

        the components is depicted.</title>

    <para>The following sections describe the architecture in more
      detail.</para>

    <section id="archdesktop"><title>Desktop and AT-SPI</title>

      <para>Orca's sole view of any application on the desktop is via
        the AT-SPI <citation><xref linkend="at-spi"
        endterm="at-spi.abbrev"/></citation>.  The AT-SPI is an
        IDL/CORBA/Bonobo-based technology <citation><xref linkend="bonobo"
        endterm="bonobo.abbrev"/></citation> that provides a common
        interface for the desktop and its applications to expose their
        GUI component hierarchy to assistive technologies such as
        Orca.  AT-SPI support is provided by toolkits such as GNOME's
        GTK+ toolkit (via gail <citation><xref linkend="gail"
        endterm="gail.abbrev"/></citation>), the Java platform (via
        the Java access bridge), and the custom
        toolkits used by applications such as Mozilla and Open
        Office.  Future support includes the Qt toolkit of KDE.</para>

      <para>Assistive Technologies interact with the AT-SPI via two
        primary means: the AT-SPI registry and accessible objects.
        The AT-SPI registry permits assistive technologies to discover
        existing applications on the desktop and to register for event
        notification for AT-SPI events (e.g., window creation, focus
        changes, object state changes, etc.) and device events (e.g.,
        keyboard input events).  Accessible objects provide the
        assistive technology with information about the application,
        and tend to mirror the actual GUI component hierarchy.
        Accessible objects can be obtained in three ways: </para>

      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
        <listitem>
          <para>From the AT-SPI registry via queries on the desktop</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>From an AT-SPI event</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>From another Accessible via parent/child relationships
            and other relationships such as "label for" and 
	    "labeled by".</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Orca's interaction with the AT-SPI is managed through
        Orca's <literal>atspi.py</literal> module.  The
        <literal>atspi.py</literal> module communicates directly with
        the AT-SPI via the AT-SPI IDL interfaces and also provides a
        number of classes that help with AT-SPI interaction:
        <literal>Registry</literal>, <literal>Accessible</literal>,
        and <literal>Event</literal>.  The full documentation for
        each of these classes is available in the pydoc for Orca
	while the following paragraphs provide a brief overview.</para>

      <para>The <literal>Registry</literal> class provides a singleton
        class instance to access to the AT-SPI
        registry.  It provides convenience methods for registering
        AT-SPI event listeners and device event listeners, and also
        provides the mechanism for starting and stopping event
        delivery from the AT-SPI registry.</para>

      <para>The <literal>Accessible</literal> class provides a wrapper
        for communicating with CORBA objects that implement the AT-SPI
        Accessible and Application interfaces. Using Python's ability
        to add new properties to a class instance at run time, Orca
        can also annotate Accessible class instances with additional
        information.  The main purpose of an Accessible is to provide
        a local cache for accessible objects, preventing the need for
        numerous round trip calls to the AT-SPI registry and
        application for information.</para>

      <para>The <literal>Event</literal> class provides a wrapper for
        converting AT-SPI events into Python <literal>Event</literal>
        instances.  The main purpose is to convert the AT-SPI
        accessible source of the event into a Python
        <literal>Accessible</literal> instance and to also provide an
        <literal>Event</literal> instance that can be annotated by
        scripts (the actual AT-SPI event delivered by the registry is 
	read-only).</para>

      <para>As illustrated in the high level Orca architecture
        diagram, the <literal>atspi</literal> module has been used to
        register event and device listeners with the AT-SPI registry.
        Each exemplary desktop application (Firefox, NetBeans, GAIM,
        StarOffice) emits AT-SPI events to the AT-SPI registry which
        then delivers them to the <literal>atspi</literal> module.
        The <literal>atspi</literal> module then calls all appropriate
        listeners for the events it receives from the AT-SPI
        registry.</para>

      <para>In this case, the <literal>orca</literal> module receives
        keyboard events, which it interprets and also sends on to the
        <literal>focus_tracking_presenter</literal> module.  Of more
        interest, however, is that the
        <literal>focus_tracking_presenter</literal> module receives
        AT-SPI events which it then passes on the script for the
        application associated with the event.  If there is no script,
        the <literal>focus_tracking_presenter</literal> will create an
        instance of the default script.  See the &scriptguidelink; for
        more information.</para>

      <para>The <literal>atspi</literal> module also registers its
        own set of event listeners that it uses to keep its local
        cache of accessible objects up to date.</para>

      <para>&detail; Because processing AT-SPI object events can be
        time consuming, and because the notification of AT-SPI object
        events is relatively "bursty," the
        <literal>focus_tracking_presenter</literal> maintains a queue
        of AT-SPI object and input device events. It adds the events
        to this queue when it receives them and processes the events
        on the GLib idle handling thread.  This permits Orca to
        survive a relatively long burst of events and also allows it
        to handle the events on a thread that is compatible with
        GLib.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="archorca"><title>Orca Module</title>

      <para>The <literal>orca</literal> module is the "main entry
        point" of Orca.  It initializes the components that Orca uses
        (atspi, speech, braille, mag) and loads the user's settings.
        It also is the first to receive all keyboard and braille input
        events and delves them out to other Orca components
        appropriately.</para>

      <para>The <literal>orca</literal> module maintains the current
        known "locus of focus" in the <literal>locusOfFocus</literal>
        field of the <literal>orca_state</literal> module.  The
        <literal>locusOfFocus</literal> is intended to represent the
        current object that the user is working with.  In simple
        terms, it is the object that is highlighted or has the dotted
        line drawn around it.  Be advised that the notion of "focus"
        differs from toolkit to toolkit.  For example, the object with
        toolkit focus may actually be the parent of the object that is
        highlighted.  The <literal>locusOfFocus</literal> is an an
        attempt to neutralize these differences across toolkits: the
        locus of focus is the individual object that is highlighted,
        has the caret, etc.</para>

      <para>Orca scripts set the locus of focus to inform Orca when
        the locus of focus has changed.  In addition, in the event
        that there was a visual appearance change to the object that
        has the locus of focus, the <literal>orca</literal> module
        provides a <literal>visualAppearanceChanged</literal> that
        scripts can use to inform Orca of this event.</para>

      <para>&note; The <literal>orca_state.locusOfFocus</literal>
        field is intended to be set only via the
        <literal>setLocusOfFocus</literal> method of the
        <literal>orca</literal> module. Because the
        <literal>setLocusOfFocus</literal> method performs bookkeeping
        and other tasks, the
        <literal>orca_state.locusOfFocus</literal> field should never
        be set directly.</para>

      <section id="archsettings"><title>settings</title> 

        <para>The <emphasis role="bold">settings</emphasis> module
          (not depicted in the high level Orca architecture diagram)
          holds preferences set by the user during configuration.
          These settings include the following: use of speech and/or
          braille, voice styles, key echo, text echo, and command
          echo.</para>

        <para>Any Orca module can check the value of a setting by
          examining the field directly in the
          <literal>settings</literal> module.  In addition, the
          <literal>orca</literal> module will import the
          <literal>user-settings</literal> module from the
          <literal>~/.orca directory</literal>, if it exists (it
	  is created as part of the configuration process that
	  is run the first time Orca is used or when the user
	  presses Insert+Space to invoke the configuration GUI).</para>

	<para>The <literal>user-settings</literal> module is a Python
          script, allowing it to contain functions, class definitions,
          etc.  The primary job of the
          <literal>user-settings</literal> is to directly set the
          values of fields in the <literal>settings</literal>
          module.</para>

        <para>&detail; the <literal>init</literal> method of the
          <literal>orca</literal> module obtains settings.  As a
          result, the <literal>user-settings</literal> module is
          imported very early in the Orca life cycle.</para>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="script"><title>Orca Scripts</title>

      <para>Internally, the <literal>orca</literal> module keeps track
        of list of <literal>PresentationManager</literal> instances
        (see the pydoc for
        <literal>presentation_manager.py</literal>). The
        <literal>FocusTrackingPresenter</literal> (see
        <literal>focus_tracking_presenter</literal>) is of the most
        interest, as it is the <literal>PresentationManager</literal>
        that manages scripts.</para>

      <para>Details on the <literal>FocusTrackingPresenter</literal>
        and Orca scripts can be found in the
        &scriptguidelink;.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="archsystemservices"><title>System Services</title>

      <para> Orca relies on existing system services to provide
        support for speech synthesis, braille, and screen
        magnification.  To interact with these services, Orca provides
        the modules described in the following sections.
      </para>

      <section id="archspeech"><title>speech</title>

        <para>The <emphasis role="bold">speech</emphasis> module
          provides Orca's Python interface to system speech services.
          Each speech service is generated by a "speech server
          factory."  There are currently two such factories: one for
          <citation><xref linkend="gnome-speech"
          endterm="gnome-speech.abbrev"/></citation> (see
          <literal>gnomespeechfactory.py</literal> and one for
          <citation><xref linkend="emacspeak"
          endterm="emacspeak.abbrev"/></citation> (see
          <literal>espeechfactory.py</literal>), though it is expected
          that support for other factories can be added in the
          future.</para>
          
        <para>Each speech factory offers up a list of
          <literal>SpeechServer</literal>s, where each
          <literal>SpeechServer</literal> is typically an interface to
          a particular speech engine.  For example, the
          <literal>espeechfactory</literal> will offer up a
          <literal>SpeechServer</literal> that talks to the Fonix
          DECtalk engine and a <literal>SpeechServer</literal> that
          talks to the IBMTTS engine.  Likewise, the
          <literal>gnomespeechfactory</literal> will offer up a
          <literal>SpeechServer</literal> that uses the
          <literal>gnome-speech</literal> interface to talk to the
          Festival Speech Synthesis System, a separate
          <literal>SpeechServer</literal> that also uses the
          <literal>gnome-speech</literal> interface to talk to the
          Fonix DECtalk engine, and so on.</para>

        <para>Each <literal>SpeechServer</literal> instance then provides
          a set of methods for actually speaking.  Each of the methods
          accepts an <literal>ACSS</literal> instance, which represents
          an aural cascading style sheet (<citation><xref linkend="acss"
          endterm="acss.abbrev"/></citation>) that defines the voice
          and voice parameter settings to use.</para>

        <para>As part of the <literal>orca-setup</literal> process,
          the user selects a particular speech factory,
          <literal>SpeechServer</literal>, and voice to use as their
          default voice.  When Orca starts, the
          <literal>speech</literal> module looks for these settings
          and connects to the appropriate speech factory and
          <literal>SpeechServer</literal>.  In the event the a
          connection cannot be made, the <literal>speech</literal>
          module attempts to find a working synthesis engine to use by
          examining its list of speech factories.  The
          <literal>speech</literal> module then provides simple
          methods that delegate to the <literal>SpeechServer</literal>
          instance.  This model allows scripts to use their own
          <literal>SpeechServer</literal> instances if they wish, but
          scripts typically just rely upon the user's default
          preferences.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="archbraille"><title>braille</title>
        <para> The <emphasis role="bold">braille</emphasis> module
          provides Orca's Python interface to the system's BrlTTY
          <citation><xref linkend="brltty"
          endterm="brltty.abbrev"/></citation> daemon.  The BrlTTY
          daemon, in turn, provides the interface to braille devices
          for both displaying braille and receiving input from the
          user.</para>

      </section>

      <section id="archmag"><title>mag</title>
        <para> The <emphasis role="bold">mag</emphasis> module

          endterm="gnome-mag.abbrev"/></citation> CORBA service(s).
          The magnification component provides methods that permit
          Orca discover screen magnification services and set their
          desktop region of interest.</para>
