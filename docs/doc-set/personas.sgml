  <chapter id="personas"><title>Personas</title>

    <para>The Orca user personas are intended to be a tool that helps
      elicit use cases and &userrequirementslink;.  The approach
      is to think of "real" users with specific disabilities
      performing specific actions.  These personas are meant to cover
      a range of typical users, both in the tasks they want to
      accomplish as well as their disabilities.  The Orca user design
      explored four personas, each of which is discussed in the
      following sections:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><link linkend="Lee">Lee</link>: a programmer who uses
        braille</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><link linkend="pat">Pat</link>: a manager who uses
          magnification and speech</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><link linkend="kim">Kim</link>: an administrative
          assistant who uses speech</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><link linkend="sam">Sam</link>: an IT staff member who
          uses speech and braille</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="lee"><title>Lee the Programmer</title>

      <para>Lee is a programmer who is primarily a braille user and
        typically performs the tasks outlined in the following
        sections.</para>

      <section><title>Write code in NetBeans</title>

        <para>Lee edits a program module in NetBeans.  Over the course
          of this editing, Lee must be able to do the following:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Determine proper indenting.  On the braille display,
              Orca shows this by using blank spaces.  Orca also has an
              option to compress horizontal spacing so as to better make
              use of braille real-estate.</para>
            <para>Lee sometimes uses speech as well, and uses separate
              commands to have Orca read the indentation level.  When in
              focus tracking mode, Lee also has the option to turn on
              the automatic speaking of this information.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>See highlighting, attributes and coloring.  On the
              braille display, Orca shows this in status cells, where
              the status cells reflect the attributes of the character
              under the current cursor position.  For braille displays
              without status cells, attribute information is shown using
              dots 7 and 8, where a "key on the braille display" is used
              to cycle through the various attribute types (underline,
              bold, etc.).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Navigate to and activate buttons and other controls
              with the braille display, especially those that cannot
              gain focus using native keystrokes.  For example, some
              code completion and information windows may not have this
              ability.  Lee uses
              functions to quickly move the braille display to various
              parts of the screen such as "top of screen" or "line 6."
              This is typically done under flat review mode, and Lee uses
              the panning and navigation keys on the braille display to do
              this.</para>
            <para>When Lee presses touch cursors on the braille display,
              they behave as if a Lee were performing a single left mouse
              click on the given object associated with the touch
              cursor.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Monitor an object on the screen.  When Lee tells
              Orca to monitor an object by pressing a key in
              combination with cursor routing buttons on the braille
              display Orca will reserve an area on the braille display
              and will continually display all current information for
              this object.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Set a part of the screen to jump to, such as a
              status bar.  When Lee lands on an object of interest,
              Lee will instruct Orca to reserve a keystroke by
              pressing a key and a touch cursor on the braille display
              to jump back to the object without moving the active
              focus. Since Lee is a braille user, Orca also allows Lee
              to jump to these objects by pressing a combination of a
              braille display key and touch cursor to jump to a
              bookmark (e.g., cursor 1 goes to bookmark 1).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
  
      </section>
  
      <section><title>Compile code in NetBeans</title>
  
        <para>Lee compiles a program module and fixes errors in
          NetBeans.  Over the course of this task, Lee must be able to
          do the following:</para>
  
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>See all errors and warnings.  For example, when Lee
              compiles a program module, focus will be moved to a window
              containing errors and warnings.  Focus tracking should
              behave properly here, and the braille display will show
              the first line in the errors and warnings window.</para>
            <para>When Lee has speech enabled, Orca will speak the first
              line of the message window.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Click on an error with a touch cursor to go to the
              error.  This acts just like performing a left mouse click
              on the error to take Lee to the editor window and source
              line for the error.  Focus tracking behaves properly here,
              and the braille display will show the line containing the
              error.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>When reviewing the screen, Orca compresses white
              space on the braille display to allow Lee to review it more
              quickly.  For example, when there are only blanks to the
              right and Lee presses the pan-right button on the
              braille display, Orca will take Lee to beginning of the
              next non-blank line.  Orca also indicates positional
              information by displaying optional "beginning of line"
              and "end of line" characters which are standard well
              known characters on the braille display.  Orca also
              optionally shows vertical screen position in status
              cells.  Orca also optionally plays sound effects to
              indicate line changes.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Run the application being created and access it.
              General screen reading functionality applies here.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
  
      </section>
  
      <section><title>Compose document in StarOffice</title>
  
        <para>Lee writes rough draft of an architecture document in
          StarOffice.  Over the course of this editing, Lee must be able
          to do the following:</para>
  
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Detect text selection.  When Lee selects text in the
              document, Orca uses dots 7 and 8 on the braille display to
              indicate the text selection.  Note that this will hide any
              capitalization held in dot 7, but that's OK.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Use spellcheck to determine misspelled word and read
              list of possible replacements.  NOTE: Lee wants to be able
              to see both the spellcheck dialog and the misspelled word
              in context.  When spellcheck dialog comes up, Orca
              provides a &wkc; to say "read the word in its
              context".  Speech will speak it.  Braille will display it,
              and any other action snaps Lee back to the spellcheck
              dialog.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Read documents in grade two braille.  Lee uses a
              &wkc; to toggle between grade one and grade two
              braille.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Detect attributes of text.  Lee does this in the same
              way as described in "highlighting, attributes and
              coloring" above.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Easily comprehend tabs and spacing.  Less does this in
              the same way as described in "determine proper indenting"
              above.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Bring up a list of toolbar items to quickly access
              with the keyboard.  For example, some applications are
              well-behaved and let you move to the toolbar.  Others do
              not.  Orca provides a &wkc; that takes Lee
              to toolbar navigation mode.  Another &wkc;
              (e.g., escape) gets you out of this mode.</para>
            <para>&note; this may also be workable via review mode,
              but the screen reader always attempts to provide Lee
              with the most efficient means for accomplishing any
              task.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Review the currently visible window with the braille
              display without moving the active cursor (e.g., the caret
              or the object with focus).  Lee uses Orca's flat review
              mode to do this, and Orca's flat review mode also allows
              Lee to select an object (and caret position in that
              object, if caret position applies).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Navigate and read all prompts and controls (including
              static text) in dialogs such as "Save as..." both in flat
              review mode and in logical order.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>View labels on the same line as the control they refer
              to followed by the control type.  NOTE: Orca automatically
              does this in braille when in focus tracking mode, but will
              not do this when in flat review mode.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Obtain "where am I" info.  In focus tracking mode,
              Orca's braille display always tells Lee this (e.g., it
              displays "file open dialog, filename text area, role" on
              the braille display - see the braille specification
              document for more information).  Updates to text areas
              cause automatic panning of braille so as to keep as much
              of text area on display as possible, with weight given to
              the caret.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
  
      </section>
  
      <section><title>Read and write e-mail with Evolution</title>
  
        <para>Lee reads and writes e-mail with Evolution to communicate
          with team.  Over the course of this task, Lee must be able to
          do the following:</para>
  
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Read all e-mail formats (e.g., plain text and html).
              Orca relies on Evolution to give it the proper AT-SPI object
              information for this.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Track the message list and easily be able to determine
              such info as time, date and message priority.  Orca places
              all this information on one line of the braille display if
              at all possible.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Spellcheck an outgoing message as described above.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>See autocompletion information as it is appearing.
              Orca displays this information to Lee on the braille
              display and keeps the cursor at the current caret
              position.</para>
            <para>When Lee has speech enabled, the speech output also speaks
              the autocomplete values.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
  
      </section>
  
      <section><title>Use terminal windows</title>
  
        <para>Lee also interacts with terminal windows on a daily basis.
          While BrlTTY is most likely the better solution for Lee (who
          is primarily a braille user), Lee may also want to access a
          GUI terminal on occasion.  Lee needs to be able to do the
          following:</para>
  
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Navigate the terminal window.  Orca updates the
              braille display to track the cursor in apps such as emacs
              and vi.  Orca also updates the braille display to track
              the navigation of fields in terminal apps (such as curses
              applications).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
  
      </section>
  
      <section><title>Use the calendar tool</title>
  
        <para>Lee sets up appointment for team design discussion using a
          calendar tool.  Over the course of this task, Lee needs to be
          able to do the following:</para>
  
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>See relevant information about each time slot.  Orca
              uses braille to show this relevant information (e.g., is
              that slot available and if not, what is scheduled?).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>See the prompts for each field when filling out an
              appointment.  Orca displays all information for the
              current field on the braille display if it will fit.  If
              it will not, Orca supports panning of the braille
              display.  Orca also makes it possible to restrict
              panning to the braille concept of the current element
              which means that the user can not pan away from the
              information about the current control.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
  
      </section>
  
      <section><title>Browse the web using Mozilla</title>
  
        <para>Lee uses Mozilla to read JDK JavaDoc, the latest Java Tips
          and Tricks article, and the latest slashdot content.  Lee
          needs to be able to do the following:</para>
  
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>View all links in a list view and also be able to
              activate them.  Orca allows Lee to arrow through the links
              and hit first letter (or perhaps enter key) to activate
              them.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Jump past links on the page to get directly to large
              blocks of text.  Orca provides a &wkc; to do this.  This
              is useful for reading documentation and articles where
              Lee is reading one page after another.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Select, cut, copy and paste blocks of text from a web
              page.  Orca relies on the semantics of the application to
              do this.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>View the URL of imagemap links with no useful
              information.  Orca provides this as part of one of its
              navigation modes.  Ideally, the browser will allow any
              user to navigate to any link, thus allowing Orca's focus
              tracking mode to handle this.  If not, however, Orca's
              flat review mode will provide this functionality.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>See labels properly associated with input fields on
              the braille display; relevant table information should be
              shown on the display when moving between columns and

      <para>Sam is a member IT staff who is primarily a speech and
         braille user.  Sam regularly performs the following
         tasks.</para>
  
      <section><title>Use terminal windows</title>
  
        <para>Sam regularly interacts with terminal windows.  While
          BrlTTY is most likely the better solution, Sam may also want to
          access a GUI terminal to do the following:</para>
  
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Navigate the terminal window.  Orca updates the
              braille display to track the cursor in apps such as emacs
              and vi.  Orca also updates the braille display to track
              the navigation of fields in terminal apps (such as curses
              apps), and provides a "speak the current line" to display
              this information.</para>

      <section><title>Use GUI-based administration tools</title>
  
        <para>Sam interacts with GUI-based tools such as update and
          network configuration on a daily basis.  This includes the

            <para>Automatically hear static text and focus information

            <para>See all information for the current field on the
              braille display if it will fit.  If it will not, Orca
              supports panning of the braille display.  Orca also
              makes it possible to restrict panning to the braille
              concept of the current element.  This will restrict
              panning from moving away from the braille information
              presented for the current control.  </para>
