Application handling in Orca
=========
When a new app appears as a child of the desktop, Orca creates an
object to respond to that app; it puts into that object references to the functions in
default.py and the keyboard handling code in default-keybindings.py; then
it looks for a Python script with a name of the form <appname.py>, and loads into the new
app object references to the functions from that script (overriding the existing ones of the
same name); and finally it looks for <appname-keybindings.py> and loads into
the new app object the keybindings from that file (overriding the ones from default-keybindings.py if there are duplicates).
