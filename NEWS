2.17.92 - 26-Feb-2007

* Much more work on Gecko.py support for Firefox.  Firefox support
  still has a ways to go, both inside Firefox itself and inside Orca.

* Fix for bug 412058 to terminate the python process better when it
  receives a TERM signal.  Note that one must send the TERM signal
  directly to the Python process.  Sending it to the shell script
  won't do since the shell script turns around and does a kill -9 on
  the Python process when it gets a TERM signal.  The motivation for
  this is to better support the code coverage analysis work that is
  being done by Lynn Monsanto.
	
* Work on bug 354479 to announce what we can about changes to the 
  battery status.  There are currently issues with the AT-SPI 
  support from the Galago support used by gnome-panel that prevent
  us from doing a more effect job here.

* Fix for bug 407480 to prevent "orca --help" and other informative
  commands from killing other Orca processes that might be running.

* Fix for bug 409708 to remove unnecessary code from Thunderbird
  script now that a few Thunderbird bugs have been fixed.

* Fix for bug 405541 to better handle Thunderbird message summary 
  list in braille.

* Fix for but 408174 to make laptop keybindings work better 
  (Thanks to community member Juan Ramon Jimenez for this fix!!!).

* Fixed for bug 405624 so Orca wille report a label even if it was
  same as previous one.

* New and updated translations (THANKS EVERYONE!!!):

  autocompletion components in Thunderbird.

* Fix for bug 398531: handle the speech preferences tab page better.

* Fix for bug 380050: Orca windows are now focused after user
  presses "Quit" or "Preferences" button in Orca Preferences

* Work on bug 400763: much improvement to the responsiveness after
  starting an update from the update manager.

* Fix for bugs 400766 and 348464: better handling of autocomplete
  entries in GTK widgets as used by the "Run..." dialog and Evolution.

* Continued work on Gecko.py script for Firefox 3.0.  We're getting
  there step by step, and it requires work both inside Firefox 3.0
  and inside Orca.

  versions of BrlTTY and BrlAPI.

* New and updated translations (THANKS EVERYONE!!!):

2.17.90 - 21-Jan-2007

* Much more work on the Gecko script (to support both Firefox and
Thunderbird).  Please note that this is still a work in progress
and much more work needs to be done both inside Orca and inside
Firefox and Thunderbird.  We're working very very hard.

* More work on the Thunderbird script to accommodate some unique
aspects of the Thunderbird UI.  We've also logged several bugs
with the Thunderbird folks to help address these things.

* Fix for bug 376791: Orca now provides better access to the buddy
list in Gaim 2.0.0 beta 5.

* Fix for bug 397797: Orca now exposes the language attribute of a
speech synthesizer voice to allow people to more easily disambiguate
voices.

* Fix for bug 394397: Orca now handles arrowing to the end of a line
better and prevents the line from being spoken again.

* Fix for bug 392939: "-" is now spoken spoken when used as a negative
sign at "some" punctuation.

* Fix for bug 395749: make sure we reference any_data values when we
get an event rather than waiting to work with them asynchronously.

* Added new 'attributes' field to the Python Accessible class
defined in at-spi.py.  This allows scripts to more easily access
the attributes of an AT-SPI object.

* New and updated translations (THANKS EVERYONE!!!):

2.17.5 - 07-Jan-2007

* Brand new script for Adobe Acrobat Reader from Joanie Diggs (Thanks
  Joanie!!!).  NOTE:  there are still some accessibility issues to
  be worked out with the team at Adobe, but this script helps provide
  some level of access to PDF documents via Reader.

* Much more work on Gecko.py script for Firefox 3.0.  There's still
  much more work to do in the Firefox 3.0 internals as well as the
  Gecko.py script.  We're still working feverishly on it.

* Update to outloud.py to add more voices and prevent crash when
  ViaVoice is used (thanks to community member Bart Bunting!!!)

* Adjusted bleeding edge Orca code to work with bleeding edge BrlAPI
  code.  We expect there to be one more change in BrlAPI 0.5.0 before
  it stabilizes, but it wasn't ready at the time of this release.

* Work on bug 350233 (actually an RFE): New script for the Liferea
  application from community member Francisco Javier Dorado Martínez
  (thanks Javier!!!).

* Work on bug 376517: Orca now speaks the unit of measure (pixels)
  after the left-margin and/or right-margin text attributes if they
  differ from the norm.

* Work on bug 347124: Added feature to allow user to tell gksu to
  disable keyboard grabs.  This is just one of the several pieces
  of the puzzle to help prevent hangs when launching sysadmin apps
  from the desktop of a non-root user.

* Fix for bug 393074: Repeated characters are now correctly read.
  (Thanks to Juan Ramon Jimenez for this fix!!!).

* Fix for bug 362546: Fixed problem speaking status bar contents
  (Insert+KP_Enter) when the status bar is a single component (e.g.,
  text field), rather than a container with multiple
  sub-components.

* Moved the keyboard layout to the first tab in the preferences
  dialog.

* Fix for bug 388620: Fixed wording of "not not" string.

* Fix for bug 388317: Prevent crash in Adobe Acrobat Reader (thanks
  Joanie!!!).

* Fix for bug 387556: Make arrowing to end of line in OOo consistent
  with what happens in gedit (thanks Joanie!!!).

* Fix for bug 388039: prevent stack trace when running orca -t.

* Fix for bug 386267: In Evolution, Orca now speaks/brailles the
  unread status instead of the read status in the message summary
  list.

* Fix for bug 382890: Extended dynamic row and column header support
  to OOo Writer tables.

* New and updated translations (THANKS EVERYONE!!!):

2.17.4 - 17-Dec-2006

* Added new support to edit your key bindings from the Orca
  preferences dialog (thanks Jorge Sandín <jorges@elsendero.es>!!!)

* Added new implementation of "Where Am I" based upon the discussion
  on the Orca user's list (thanks for your work, everyone!).

* Fix for bug 382891: Flat review now works in the face of empty text
  areas (thanks Joanie Diggs!!).

* Fix for bug 381391: Flat review initialization now handles
  situations where the caret is at the end of a text area (thanks
  Joanie Diggs!!).

* Fix for bug 382408: Eliminated significant sluggishness when
  navigating in OOo Writer tables (many thanks to our Orca users
  for speaking up about this!).

* Fix for bug 382495: orca --setup is now localized (thanks Takao!).

* Fix for bug 382418: Orca now announces when you enter/leave a table
  in OOo Writer documents.

* Fix for bug 382880: Orca now provides speech output when tabbing
  among cells in OOo Writer documents.

* Fix for bug 382888: Orca now announces when you cross a cell boundary
  in OOo Writer tables.

* Fix for bug 382415: Orca now honors speak cell/row setting in OOo
  Writer tables.

* Fix for bug 384393: Orca now reports bold or underline in OOo Writer
  when Insert F is pressed (this was a regression).

* Fix for bug 375395: Orca now speaks blank lines in Evolution when
  appropriate.

* Allow Orca to run better under gdm for accessible login.  With this
  work, we've been informed by the gdm maintainer that Orca is the
  first assistive technology ever that can run without requiring gdm
  to have a home directory. NOTE: the typical line to add to
  /etc/X11/gdm/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents is something like the
  following, depending upon what you want Orca to do when it starts:

  <Control>o  1 1000 10000  /bin/sh -c "GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge ctrun -l child -i none orca -n -d main-window"

* Improved support for BrlTTY v3.8.  Orca will now first attempt to
  use the new Python bindings for BrlAPI 0.5 (which is what comes with
  BrlTTY v3.8) and then fallback to its own bindings for BrlAPI 0.4.1
  (which is what comes with BrlTTY 3.7.2).  When using BrlTTY v3.8,
  Orca is now a better BrlTTY citizen: Orca only consumes BrlTTY
  events that it cares about, and Orca is also smarter about which TTY
  it chooses. NOTE: Our plan is to eventually retire Orca's BrlAPI 0.4.1
  Python bindings as BrlAPI 0.5 becomes more prevalent.

* More work done with Gecko.py (the Firefox script), but there's still
  a lot of work to do here, both on the Firefox and Orca
  implementations.

* More work done with Thunderbird, but there's still a lot more work
  to be done with it as well, both on the Firefox and Orca
  implementations.

* Improvements and additions to the Orca regression test harness.

* New and updated translations (THANKS!):

2.17.3 - 03-Dec-2006

* Implementation of RFE 373566: Added support to switch between
  desktop and laptop bindings.  Also added support for allowing the
  Caps Lock key to act as the Orca modifier.

* Added feature to the preferences dialog to present the key bindings
  as progress towards RFE 354970.  Many thanks to Jorge Sandín for
  this work!

* Implementation of RFE 354463 - The "Find" command is now working,
  with the exception of bug 381391.  Many thanks to Joanie Diggs for
  her hard work on this!

* Implementation of RFE 376002: Added command line options to tell
  Orca to start with speech, braille, and/or magnification.  This
  is mostly to aid things such as accessible installs and logins.

* Work on RFE 371122: much of the "Where am I" command has been
  implemented, though we're still testing and refining it.

* A fair amount of work has been done on the Gecko script for Firefox 3.
  Please note this is still a work in progress and is still somewhat
  unstable.  The Orca and Firefox teams are working feverishly on the
  support and are still targetting Firefox 3 for compelling web
  access.

* Continued work on identifying (and resolving when possible) accessibility
  issues in other applications.  Please do a search on the "orca" component
  at http://bugzilla.gnome.org for summaries containing the "[blocked]"
  string to get a list.

* In the callback for the Cancel button on the Orca Preferences
  window, the code has been adjusted to destroy that window, so that
  the next time the user displays the Preferences dialog, all of the
  settings will reflect the current running state rather than how the
  user left the GUI components before hitting the Cancel button.

* Fix for bug 372808: Orca now reports the appropriate header
  information when tabbing between tables.

* Fix for bug 377085: family-name text attribute are no longer
  malformed for multi-word family names.

* Implementation of RFE 377955: Suggested additions to pronunciation
  dictionary.

* Fix for bug 376347: Orca no longer speaks new-line in the
  Evolution menu bar.

* Fix for bug 372964: Added text-attribute settings.

* Fix for bug 376006: Handle minimum increment value of 0.0 when
  calculating decimal places to present for sliders.

* Fix for bug 358467: Mapped the time-admin to the users-admin
  script so that Orca can correctly read the table of time servers.

* Change for bug 364529. Initial value in the Preferences Glade file
  for pitch is now 5.0 and not 9.0.  Also allow voice styles to be
  undefined.  The hypertext link voice will now initially derive
  its values from the default voice settings.

* Partial fix for bug 356060: Provide access to tree item level and
  state in OOo Navigator.

* Defensive fix for bug 353432: Orca no longer announces name changes
  for objects who tell us their name has changed when it really
  hasn't.

* Work on bug 363815: Implement the ability to have application
  specific settings.

* Fix for bug 364452: make sure Orca's name shows up as "orca" and not
  "-c" in at-poke.

* Fix for bug 319666: Orca now announces "0 items" when encountering
  various empty objects.

* Fix for bug 381653: Orca now announces the new state of a checkbox
  when it is changed inside a table cell.

* More work on the specification and regression test suite.

* New and updated translations (THANKS!):

2.17.2 - 05-Nov-2006

* Updates to requirements and specifications documents.

* Fair amount of work on Gecko.py script, though it is not at all ready
  for compelling access to Firefox (and hence the web) yet.  Also did
  a fair amount of work looking at flat review and filing a number of
  bugs against the AT-SPI implementation in progress in Firefox 3.

* Fix for bug 369292: gcalctool now speaks the new result when
  the "=" button is activated.

* Fix for bug 337063: Orca now supports an alternate .orca location via
  the -u and --user-prefs-dir command line options.

* Fix for bug 365939: reading of message list in Evolution now provides
  more concise information for check box items.

* For for bug 353422: Mapped vte application to gnome-terminal script and
  also fixed the "backspace" problem in gnome-terminal.

* Workaround for bug 368626: prevent gnome-panel from crashing and add
  some defensive code to work in the case where there is no event
  source in an at-spi event.

* Fix for bug 338838: Orca now speaks "newline" only when moving by
  character or word.

* Fix for bug 358467: Orca now reads check items status
  in "Users and groups" dialog of users-admin application.

* Fix for bug 355733: SayAll function now works better for OpenOffice.

* Fix for bug 364086: Orca no longer reports "paragraph 0 paragraph"
  when you begin typing in a OpenOffice Calc cell.

* Fix for bug 363801: Orca provides confirmation when dynamic row and/or
  column headers are set.  In addition, column numbers in OpenOffice
  Calc are now spoken as column letters.

* Fix for bug 363807: Orca now reports the number of items in a table.

* Fix for bug 321184: Orca now supports a custom pronunciation dictionary.

* Fix for bug 363802: Orca no longer says "cell" when navigating from
  cell to cell in OpenOffice Calc.

* Fix for bug 363796: Second press of a letter in learn mode now provides
  the phonetic ("military") spelling of the letter.

* Fix for bug 355525: Orca handled EMBEDDED_OBJECT_CHARACTERs in text
  better.

* Fix for bug 357063: If there are a bunch of repeated characters
  (like the greater thans) on a line that also has text, Orca respects the
  punctuation settings in Orca.  But, if the repeated characters are on
  a line by themselves (i.e.  30 greater thans, nothing else), Orca
  indicates their presence ("30 greater than characters") regardless
  of the level of punctuation.

* Fix for bug 344249: Orca reports menu mnemonics as part of the
  "Where am I" functionality.

* Fix for bug 348975: the state for radio buttons is now spoken prior
  to the role.

* Fix for bug 363423: Orca now speaks the "Applications" menu if it is
  brought up while the focus is in a GAIM chat window.

  column of text in OOo Writer documents.

* Fix for bug 357829: Use real active descendant of a table cell when
  looking for locus of focus in flat review.

* Fix for bug 341406: Orca now presents results when finding files.

* Fix for bug 319783: Orca now speaks/brailles the insensitive states
  of objects if they are insensitive.

* Fix for bug 338111: Use new BrlAPI Python bindings if they exist.

* Fix for bug 348693: Announcement of new mail in Evolution is now
  toggleable via Insert-m.

* Fix for bug 361670: flat review no longer fails after minimizing the
  Orca main window.

* Fix for bug 355893: Network Preferences "Port" label is now reported
  by Orca.

2.17.1 - 14-Oct-2006

* Implemented RFE 361167: add use of Insert+r and Insert+c as a means
  to specify dynamic column headers and dynamic row headers in Open
  Office spreadsheets.

* Fixed bug 361747: provide support for the 'weight' text attribute.
  Also make sure that character text attributes are handled correctly.

* Implemented RFE 319657: In gedit, Orca now speaks the context of
  search ('find') results.

* Implemented RFE 339789: Added code to "Where Am I" to report the
  number of items in menus and submenus as well as the current
  position of a menu item or menu in its menu.

* Fix for bug 350523: In gcalctool, give reference to accessible name
  of a button over the text that is being displayed on a button.

* Added use of Python logging API to log speech and braille at the
  INFO level.  This will dovetail in with the larger testing work
  being done for GNOME.

* Fix for bug 350219: provide announcement when you create a new
  document for the very first time in Open Office.

* Fix for bug 354785: read the entire line in the "Process Fields"
  preferences table in gnome-system-monitor. Fix involved a rework
  of how table cells are brailled and spoken.

* Fix for bug 349954: do not make assumptions that UTF-8 strings
  contain only single byte characters.  Handle this by converting
  to the Python unicode type before doing processing such as
  string length and character analysis.

* Added 'getText' method to script to provide a means for the script
  to work around shortcomings in some accessible text implementations.

* Exploratory work on the Gecko.py script to help debug and provide
  an understanding of what the Gecko AT-SPI implementation is providing
  us.

* Added ZONE support for goBegin and goEnd functions of flat review
  (thanks Joanie Diggs!)

* Improvements to the test harness.  NOTE: as a result of the GNOME
  Boston 2006 Accessibility Summit, we may revise this harness as
  the overall testing strategy for GNOME develops.

* New and updated translations (THANKS!):

2.17.0 - 04-Oct-2006

* Updates to user requirements and functional specification.

* Added Orca man pages.

* New and improved regression test harness.

* Added new Orca main window to allow one to have a GUI option for
  quitting Orca and invoking the configuration settings.  The appearance
  of this window can be enabled/disabled in the new "General" tab
  of the configuration dialog.  Also added "Apply" button the configuration
  GUI window.

* Added new Orca "Quit" dialog.

* Refactor in default.py and other scripts to add isTextArea method to
  determine if an object is a text area or not.  This allows us to deal
  with the growing number of things that are text areas, but choose to
  give themselves different roles (e.g., GTK's 'text', OpenOffice's
  'paragraph', and Gecko's 'entry').

* Added Gecko.py toolkit script to cover apps that use the Mozilla
  Gecko toolkit (e.g., Firefox, Thunderbird, Yelp, etc.).  Some work
  done with new Firefox 3 at-spi implementation, but much work is
  still needed.

0.9.0 - 21-Aug-2006

* Updates to the requirements guide and input and output style guides.

* For regression testing purposes, allow us to get what would have
been spoken even if settings.speechServerFactory is None.

* Improvements to the "orca" shell script.  Provides better
availability and also provides a better means for killing/restarting
Orca.

* New orca.desktop file and icon.

* New latent support to allow the setting of the source and target
displays for magnification.  If it exists,
settings.magnifierTargetDisplay will be treated as an X Window System
DISPLAY string (e.g., ":0.1") that says where to display the magnified
area (the default is split screen magnification on the primary
display).  If it exists, settings.magnifierSourceDisplay will be
treated as an X Window System DISPLAY string (e.g., ":0.0") that says
what is to be magnified.

* Many thanks to our friends at Baum for providing many fixes and testing
for the Java platform:

   * Fix for bug 351891: provide better handling when receiving an
     active descendant changed for an object with no active
     descendant.

   * Fix for bug 350740: report combo box selection change for Java
     applications.

   * Fix for bug 350736: better presentation for focused lists in Java
     applications.

   * Fix for bug 350739: improve list navigation for the Java platform.

   * Fix for bug 350724: improve handling of LABEL_FOR and LABELLED_BY
     objects.

   * Fix for bug 351914: provide better support for combo boxes on
     Java platform.

   * Fix for bug 352233: prevent exception when getting the child of
     an object from a Java application.

   * Fix for bug 352238: do not assume last input event was a keyboard
     event.

* Fix for bug 350213: provide defensive programming for combo box
braille generator.

* Fix for bug 351501: do not generate a traceback when trying to
braille Evolution message folder tree.

* Fix for bug 350854: handle object:state-changed:focused events so
Orca will recognize when GEdit's edit area has focus again after a
maximize/unmaxmize of GEdit's window on GNOME 2.15/16.

* Fix for bug 352073: provide "gnome-python with bonobo" hint for
missing dependency.  Also provide a note at the end providing a more
obvious message when support for BrlTTY/BrlAPI cannot be found.

* Fix for bug 351847: add defensive code in the event the AT-SPI
implementation gives us a cycle when looking at the
RELATION_NODE_CHILD_OF relation.

* Fix for bug 349465: take some defensive actions in the event that
the AT-SPI implementation has implemented getTextAtOffset incorrectly
(i.e., it gives back garbage for offsets).

* Fix for bug 350218: GtkDemo Editable cells tree demo no longer
speaks both cells in a row

* Fix for bug 350294: Eliminate TypeError in _initGUIState in GUI prefs.

* Fix for bug 350212: Improve speaking of Spin Button changes.

0.2.8 - 06-Aug-2006
* Orca has been approved for inclusion into GNOME 2.16!!!  YEAH!
  Thanks everyone for your support.
* Many thanks also to the team from Baum for their contributions in
  improving the support for the Java platform.
* Much improvement in the reliability and availability department.
  Thanks very much to community members for helping test Orca and
  provide us with constructive feedback and informative bug reports.
  These community members include: Joanmarie Diggs, Al Puzzuoli,
  Fco. Javier Dorado Martínez, and Cody Hurst.
* Improvements to Yelp access.
* Improvements to Firefox 2 chrome.  NOTE: we are targeting Firefox 3
  as the means for providing compelling access to web content.
* The main 'orca' executable is now a shell script that launches the
  Python process for orca.  It includes some utilities to clean up
  stray processes and latent support to automatically detect failures
  in Orca and restart it if necessary.  We will be improving this
  script prior to the GNOME 2.16 release.  Your testing and feedback
  will be helpful!
* Improved support for the emacspeak speech service, including better
  ACSS support for DECtalk and overall support for rate/pitch
  parameters.  Many thanks to Joanmarie Diggs for her contributions to
  this space.  The community model works!
* Fix for bug 347691: In standard print dialog, printer table items
  not always spoken/displayed.
* Fix for bug 345462: Orca should speak changes when moving up a level
  in menus.
* Fix for bug 341371: Orca will not report the file name in file
  picker when there is only one file existing in current folder.
* Fix for bug 319738: The child routine() needs to be more careful
  about indices out of bounds.
* Fix for bug 319660: Exiting learn mode should display current locus
  of focus.
* Fix for bug 348980: Get braille cursor routing keys working again.
* Fix for bug where window activated and deactivated events can arrive
  out of order.  Thanks to Baum for this fix!
* Defensive programming in the event that expected object specializations
  (e.g., text, component, selection, etc.) don't exist.  Thanks to Baum
  for this fix!
* Created orca.desktop to add orca to menu items.
* Migrated to LINGUAS model (http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/PoLinguas).
* Added additional testing and debugging utilities.  Also added
  additional helper lines to ~/.orca/user-settings.py that make
  it more convenient to turn on/off various debugging and testing
  utilities.
* Pychecker fixes and also eliminated circular imports in the python
  modules.
* Additional keystrokes files for testing.  We're ramping up our regression
  tests and hope to have a more complete set by the GNOME 2.16
  release.
* Provide smoother handling of the crosswires and cursor in the
  magnifier when tracking the mouse.

0.2.7 - 24-Jul-2006
* Much work on hangs.  It's better, but we still have work to do.
* Vastly improved work with GAIM.  Also added Insert+{1,2,3,...} to
  allow you to read the last n messages.
* Fix bug 348084 - fail gracefully if speech is not available.
* Handle situations where the label the label for a FILLER or PANEL is
  done by placing an unbound label as the first child of the
  FILLER/PANEL and the content of the FILLER/PANEL is the second
  child.
* Fix bug 348131 - make SayAll perform properly in Evolution.
* Moved the Orca specific keybindings out of the init() routine in
  orca.py over to the setupInputEventHandlers and getKeyBindings()
  routines in default.py.
* Reworked how Orca handles "no focus."  It is much better now.
* Added new keynames for various keys.
* Fixed bug #347228 - correctly identify state of top level item in
  some tree tables.
* Improved access to Evolution and StarOffice set up wizards.
* Additional work on access to the Java platform.
* Added in support for numeric keypad 8 double-clicking, which spells
  the current line, and numeric keypad 5 double clicking, which spells
  the current word.

0.2.6 - 09-Jul-2006
* Addition of verbalized punctuation settings.
* Addition of spoken indentation information for lines.
* Adjustments to brief verbosity settings for speech.
* Additional work on automatic reading of the entire row for a table cell,
  which is controlled by the orca.settings.readTableCellRow property.
* Additional work on the StarOffice script to better support
  configuration wizards.
* Additional work on Evolution to better support configuration wizards.
* Very preliminary support for the Java platform.
* Moved a number of utilities from various places to util.py.
* Moved http server support into its own module.  Note that
  orca.settings.speechServerPort is now defunct and has been replaced
  by orca.settings.httpServerPort.
* Fixes for reading table row and column headers.
* Fix for bug 347054 to allow readTableCellRow and speechVerbosityLevel
  settings to be set properly from the configuration GUI.
* Fix for bug 343897 to allow configuration GUI to pop to top when it
  is shown.  This requires a more recent version of PyGTK (2.9.3) to work.
* Fix for bug 341388 to stop speech for an object when its window loses focus.
* Fixes for bug 343133 to do defensive programming in flat review to
  help prevent hangs.
* Fix for bug 345472 to not assume the last input event was a keyboard event.
* More work on bug 319652 to reduce even more hangs.
* Fix for bug 344880 - process command line arguments even if a11y is not

==========

0.2.5 - 11-Jun-2006
* Re-map keyboard bindings and add additional keyboard bindings.
  See http://live.gnome.org/Orca/KeyboardCommands for the list.
* Improvements to StarOffice support to provide better access to text
  documents and spreadsheets.  Also get rid of spurious "0.00" text
  that was showing up in braille for StarOffice buttons.
* Addition of announcing text selection as it is selected and unselected.
* Generalize the "read table cell row" functionality.  If you press
  Insert+F11, it will toggle the feature to read the entire row of
  a table or just the selected table cell when you move from row to row.
* Improved support for SayAll of text objects (SayAll for flat review
  is still on the to do list).
* Addition of self-voicing module to tell Orca to be quiet when a
  self-voicing application is present.
* Addition of ability to turn Orca into a speech server that can
  accessed via simple HTTP commands (default port is 20433, but this
  is customizable via orca.settings.speechServerPort).  This will
  allow self-voicing applications to use Orca for their speech, thus
  letting them get the user's speech settings preferences.
* Addition of orca.settings.enableBrailleGrouping (default=False).
  NOTE: this represents a change in the UI for Orca - the behavior to
  date has been to always group menu items on the braille display.
  The system responsiveness was bad for large menus, however, so we
  decided to make this an optional feature turned off by default.
* Addition of utility to report information on the currently active
  script.  This is primarily for helping script writers do debugging
  and is accessed by pressing Insert+F3.
* Addition of orca.settings.cacheAccessibles (default=True) as a
  means to turn the local caching of accessible objects on or off.
  This is primarily an orca developer debugging feature.
* Fix for bug 344218 - gnome-terminal would not be presented properly
  if it was started after Orca.
* Fix for bug 343666: pressing buttons on braille displays could cause
  a hang.
* Partial fix for bug 342022 - provide some defensive mechanisms to help
  prevent some hangs.
* Fix for bug 343133 - do not hang when doing a flat-review of a man
  page in gnome-terminal.
* Fix for bug #343013 - the command line option strings should not be
  translatable.
* Partial fix for bug 319652 - become a better Python thread citizen
  to help reduce hangs.
* Fix for bug 342303 - stop speech when the user presses the mouse button.
* Fix for bug 342122 - use all labels for an object when presenting
  an object.
* Fix for bug 342133 - do not read all labels in gnome-window-properties
  application when it appears.
* Fix for bug 341415 - when moving between workspaces with metacity,
  eliminate redundant output and also make sure workspace names are
  announced.
* Refactor of various modules to move script writing utilities into
  util.py.
* More fleshing out of the test plan.

==========

0.2.4 - 15-May-2006
* Addition of text and GUI preferences configuration tools.
  NOTE: 0.2.4 eliminates orca-setup and replaces it with the
  "--setup" (GUI or text, depending upon your environment),
  "--gui-setup" (GUI), "--text-setup" (text), "--no-setup"
  (bypass any automatic setup mechanism - useful for running
  with gdm accessible login) command line options to the
  "orca" command.  You can also bring up the GUI while orca
  is running by pressing Insert+space.
  WARNING: 0.2.4 also introduces an incompatible change to
  the configuration file and requires you to "rm -rf ~/.orca"
  and rerun orca setup.
* Fix for bug 340662 - do not require the desktop to be running
  to set up orca preferences.
* Addition of support for magnification similar to that in
  Gnopernicus.
* Fix for bug 331512 - addition of key and word echo.  We need
  community feedback on this.
* Work on specifying the external dependencies for building
  and running Orca.
* Fix for bug where metacity workspaces (accessed via
  Ctrl+Alt+Arrow) were being announced as inaccessible.
* Work on dealing with the Java platform giving us
  CORBA::Unknown objects instead of Bonobo::Unknown objects.
  Java platform support, however, still has a long way to go.
* Work on coping with CORBA COMM_FAILURES a little better.
