2005-03-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Upgrade to brltty-3.6.1 (TODO: perhaps add backwards
	compatibility in if people complain.).
	* Add *.pyc (compiled *.py files) to src/orca/.cvsignore.
	* Use try/except blocks more sparingly to allow for easier
	debugging.  Also add more debugging features to debug.py.
	A quite note on debugging: add "debug = True" to 
	~/.orca/settings.py to turn debugging on.
	* Fix presentation of radio and checkbox menu items.
	* Make menus speak like Gnopernicus for now.
	* Backout a11y.py workaround for Nautilus shortcomings; it turns
	out this workaround was hurting the overall logic.
	
2005-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Remove src/orca/dispatcher.py as it was obsoleted by the
	  dispathcher table in a11y.py.

	  TODO comments.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py (init): remove call to core.init() as this

	* src/orca/speech.py (init): add extra parameters to call to
	bonobo.activation.activate_from_id as a result of change to

	* src/orca/a11y.py (Accessible.__get_relations): New

	sure things work right with Java.
	(Accessible.__get_app): Get app also fails if the thing it finds
	is not an application.
	(onWindowActivated): Make sure focussedAp is narrowed so it works
	right with Java.
	(onFocus): Since we're tracking the active application, objects
	which get focus get their app attribute set to the active
	application-- this hack is needed for Nautilus.
	(getLabel): Ensure the target that we get from a relation is an
	accessible wrapper.

	* src/orca/Gecko.py (presentNextHypertext): Fixed to use new
	accessible wrapper.
