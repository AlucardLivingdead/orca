        * src/orca/scripts/Makefile.am src/orca/scripts/Evolution.py
          src/orca/settings.py
          Adding in a "stub" Evolution script that currently does nothing
          except interpose on the onFocus() method and always pass the 
          event onto the parent class. This script will be extended as needed.

2005-11-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/{a11y.py,braillegenerator.py,flat_review.py,
	focus_tracking_presenter.py,hierarchical_presenter.py,
	kbd.py,orca.py,speech.py,speechgenerator.py}: use "for i in range"
	idiom instead of the awkward "while" loops.
	
	* src/orca/{braille.py,debug.py,default.py,
	focus_tracking_presenter.py,hierarchical_presenter.py,kbd.py,
	mag.py,orca.py,settings.py}: remove unnecessary globals.

	* src/orca/*.py, src/orca/scripts/*.py: gross pychecker
	sweep to eliminate a number of potential bugs and ugliness.
	
	* src/orca/{Makefile.am,acss.py,dectalk.py,default.py,
	espeechfactory.py,gnomespeechfactory.py,orca-setup.in,
	orca.py,outloud.py,settings.py,speech.py,speechserver.py},
	src/orca/scripts/{Gecko.py,metacity.py}: new speech structure
	done in collaboration with T.V. Raman of Google who donated
	code under the LGPL license.  NOTE: THIS REQUIRES YOU TO
	RERUN ORCA-SETUP.

2005-11-14  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/Makefile.am src/orca/keynames.py
          src/orca/orca.py
          Before key event are spoken in the _keyEcho() routine, they are 
          checked against a key event dictionary to see if there are 
          localized  words to be spoken instead.

2005-11-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
	src/orca/scripts/*.py, docs/doc-set/script_guide.sgml: eliminate
	need for script factory paradigm.  
	
2005-11-09  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/default.py,
	src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py, src/orca/orca-setup.in,
	src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py, src/orca/speech.py,
	src/orca/scripts/Gecko.py, src/orca/scripts/gaim.py,
	src/orca/scripts/gcalctool.py, src/orca/scripts/metacity.py: First
	pass at new speech system based on conversations with T.V. Raman.
	NOTE: THIS REQUIRES YOU TO RERUN ORCA-SETUP.  If you don't orca
	will fail on startup.

2005-11-09  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

	* Added test directories
	
2005-11-07  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * configure.in, docs/pydoc,
          docs/Makefile.am, docs/pydoc/Makefile.am
          Added in a new .../docs/pydoc directory where pydoc HTML
          documentation is generated for all the Orca Python files.

2005-11-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: really delete scripts when
	an application exits.  Fix for bug 319776.
	
2005-11-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/{a11y,default,focus_tracking_presenter,orca,script}.py:
	bubble COMM_FAILURES up to a higher level to allow for better
	tracking and debugging of these events.
	
2005-11-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/default.py
          (Per suggestion from Will) Moved the braille.addLine() call
          in the updateBraille() method, to prevent a "list index out of
          range" exception.

2005-11-03  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py:
          Added a onCaretMoved() method which simply calls the
          same method in its parent class. Now movement from one line in
          a text document to the next, just results in the new line
          being spoken once (compared with both the last line and the
          new line being spoken upto two times each). Need to investigate
          further why this happens.

        * src/orca/braillegenerator.py
          Added a check in getBrailleRegions(). Sometimes, for some 
          unknown reason, the child is None. We now test for this, 
          rather than cause a traceback.

        * src/orca/a11y.py:
          Fix from Will. Adjustments to the makeAccessible() method to
          better handle invalid objects in the local cache. This routine 
          no longer throws an InvalidObjectError exception.

2005-11-03  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/debug.py,
	src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: toString work on 
	an accessible (note there is still plenty of opportunity
	for object-oriented programming in a11y.py).
	
2005-11-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/scripts/StarOffice.py: added a call to:

          self.keybindings = keybindings.KeyBindings()

          in the __init__ method, to prevent Orca going into flat 
          review mode when you typed in something like "t".

2005-11-02  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: added a debug message
          to one of the except: clauses in processObjectEvent().

        * src/orca/a11.y: adjusted some of the debug messages in the 
          __get_app routine to check whether obj.name and 
          obj.parent.name are None, in which case "None" is printed;
          otherwise "'<name>'".

2005-10-31  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

	* Initial version of StarOffice.py script. Support for
          "object:state-changed:armed" events.

2005-10-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/debug.py: add ability to send debug output to a
	file (via debug.setDebugFile).  This should allow us to pass
	in a non-buffered file from user-settings.py, hopefully 
	allowing us to better track where orca is hanging.
	* src/orca/*.py, src/orca/scripts/*.py: make the voicename
        for speaking be an optional parameter with a default value
        of "default".
	* src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
	src/orca/settings.py: fix for bug 32063 - provide a more
	flexible, general-purpose, and user-settable script discovery
	mechanism.
	
2005-10-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* QUICKSTART: add libgail-gnome to Ubuntu section as well as
	more apt-get stuff needed to build libgail-gnome.
	* src/orca/orca.py: fail a bit more gracefully if braille,
	speech, or mag are not available at run time.
	
2005-10-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

        * src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py
          Added in a "debug.printException(debug.LEVEL_FINEST)" in
          _createScript() in the exception cluse when trying to load
          custom scripts (very useful during debugging).

2005-10-28  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

	* src/orca/flat_review.py: adjusted three debug statements to
          pass two parameters, not three.

2005-10-28  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.in, src/orca/orca.py: move all logic out of
	orca.in and move it into a new orca.py:main to help with 
	debugging.
	* src/orca/*.py: do not silently pass on any exceptions - at
	least print an exception at debug.LEVEL_FINEST.  Also attempt
	to provide some debug output inside while loops that could
	potentially never exit.
	
2005-10-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am: take care in packaging on 64-bit
	platforms
	* src/orca/kbd.py: fix problem with not registering enough
	handlers to cover all possible modifier mask combinations;
	refactor a little bit to help enable testing with XEVIE.
	
2005-10-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
	various calls to _getBrailleTextForAvailability and
        _getSpeechForAvailability for radio, check and ordinary menuitems.

2005-10-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* TODO: Moved all TODOs to bugzilla.gnome.org as bugs and RFEs
	for the Orca component.  Also went through all the source code
	and logged all TODOs in there as bugs and RFEs, placing references
	to the bugzilla bug numbers in the source code.
	
2005-10-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* QUICKSTART: create and update.
	* src/brl/brlmodule.c: throw exceptions instead of printing
	  errors when attempting to initialize/connect to BrlTTY.
	* src/orca/braille.py: set default braille display size to 32
	  (this is for testing purposes and the default matches the
	  actual display size of our primary tester)
	* src/orca/orca-setup.in: only enable accessibility if it has
	  not already been enabled, thus avoiding a confusing message
	
2005-10-20  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: add ability to provide
	a mapping between application name and script module name
        * src/orca/scripts/*: refactor scripts into their own package
	
2005-10-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/script.py, src/orca/input_event.py,
	docs/doc-set/script_guide.sgml: begin working on script 
	writing guide.
	
2005-10-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speech.py: do not lose last text sent when performing
	a reset after detecting a speech driver failure.
	
2005-10-11  Pawan Chitrakar  <pchitrakar@gmail.com>

	* configure.in: Added ne in ALL_LINGUAS

2005-10-07  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/flat_review.py: eliminate a major source of hangs
	for flat review: getTextAtOffset is typically implemented 
	incorrectly across (and possibly within) toolkits.
        * src/orca/gaim.py: improved braille and speech experience (at
	least for AIM)

2005-10-06  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>
        
        * src/orca/flat_review.py: handle text objects that have
        children by ignoring the children
        * src/orca/gaim.py: hacking to get chat working again
        (at least for AIM)

2005-10-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>
        
        * src/orca/default.py: add support for no focus.

2005-09-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py,
	src/orca/braillegenerator.py: more work on keeping the spatial 
	layout of braille relatively consistent.
	
2005-09-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py:
	hopefully a little better at flat review navigation using the 
	buttons on the braille display
        * src/orca/braille.py: provide additional methods to find our way
	around and also provide more control over panning around.
	* src/orca/flat_review.py: provide ability to explicitly set the
	character of interest as well as ability to pass a character offset
	to a zone and find the word associated with it.
	
2005-09-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py: used
	rolenames constants instead of hard coded strings.
	* src/orca/default.py: use "above" and "below" semantics instead
	of "previous line" and "next line" for BrlTTY LNUP and LNDN.
	* src/orca/flat_review.py: in flat review mode, automatically pan
	to begin/end of previous/next lines when panning in braille.
	
2005-09-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py: don't speak flat review info if the user
	navigated via input from the braille display.
	* src/orca/braille.py: strip trailing "\n" from lines for flat
	review mode.
	* src/orca/flat_review.py: do not add zero-sized zones to flat 
	review context.
	
2005-09-12  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py: 
	more work on flat review - rudimentary braille input and output
	working.
	
2005-09-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/flat_review.py: 
	fair amount of work to get rudimentary flat review mode working
	(with speech only at this point).
	
2005-08-29  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py: Add cancel button to record keystrokes dialog.
	* src/orca/orca-setup.in: fix typo in orcadir name (it was gorcadir).
	* src/tools/sanity_checker.py: tool to do a rough sanity check on
	keystroke files recorded by Orca or record_keystrokes.py
	
2005-08-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/default.py: better scrolling
	of braille display when the caret moves (e.g., by pressing a
	touch cursor or doing some keyboard navigation action).
	* src/orca/default.py: implement simple line clustering 
	algorithm inspired by a number of seminal OCR publications.
	* src/orca/braille.py: implement suggestion from Dave Mielke
	to handle spurious keyboard repeats from various display
	drivers (e.g., the Alva).
	
2005-08-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/default.py: begin
	implementing spatial analysis techniques.	
	* src/orca/a11y.py: clear the cache properly when the parent
	changes.
	
2005-08-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

        * Many files: add keybindings support to workaround the fact that
	AT-SPI doesn't give us keysyms.  As a result, keypad keys look
	like other keys on the keyboard (e.g., the left arrow on the
	keypad looks similar to the left arrow on the keyboard).  The only
	way to distinguish these things right now is by keycode.
	But...different systems emit different keycodes, so we need to
	resolve keycodes at runtime.  Also took this opportunity to fix
	the problem where key releases of Orca keys were always being
	passed on to applications rather than being consumed.  Note that
	all these changes introduce a new dependency on glib and also
	require the DISPLAY environment variable to be set.

2005-08-23  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: add
	ability to record keystrokes to a file - press the "Pause" key
	to start/stop recording.
	* src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/speech.py: change LEVEL_INFO
	output to be more test friendly.
	
2005-08-16  Mike Pedersen <michael.pedersen@sun.com>

	* src/orca/rolenames.py: reduced verbosity for page tabs and page
	tab lists

2005-08-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braillegenerator.py: reduce verbosity for page tabs.
	* src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
	src/orca/braillegenerator.py: include accessible image description
	for icons if it exists.
	* src/orca/eventsynthesizer.py, src/orca/Makefile.am: create to
	allow mouse and keyboard events to be synthesized by Orca
	* src/orca/braille.py: use eventsynthesizer to generate mb1 clicks
	for those objects that don't have actions (e.g., page tabs).	
	* src/orca/a11y.py: do not cache extents because they can get out
	of date if the object is moved and we currently do not have a way
	to determine if this has happened.
	
2005-08-16  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braille.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py: show 
	text lines with their labels.
	* src/orca/rolenames.py: minor consistency tweaking on rolenames.
	
2005-08-11  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py: hack to better support the very poor
	application behavior exhibited by Evolution's account setup
	wizard: it will end up in situations where the active dialog
	doesn't have any components with focus.
	* src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py, src/orca/a11y.py,
	src/orca/speechgenerator.py: first pass at automatically speaking
	panels when they are realized on the screen.
	
2005-08-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braillegenerator.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py:
	remove extraneous "region" field from constructor.
	* src/orca/default.py: add factory methods to get braille and
	speech generator objects so as to allow subclasses to more
	easily override the generators.	
	* src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: ignore the
	"object:state-changed:iconified" event for now to help avoid
	tickling a nasty bug with gedit.  Tickling gedit when it is
	starting can cause gedit to issue the following message:
	(gedit:31434): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid cast from
	`SpiAccessible' to `BonoboControlAccessible'.  It seems as though
	whenever this message is issued, gedit will hang when you try to
	exit it.	
	* src/orca/gedit.py, src/orca/Makefile.am: new script to override
	the _getSpeechForFrame method so as to avoid tickling the same bug
	described above.
	* src/orca/a11y.py: add ability to turn local caching of object
	values on or off via the a11y.CACHE_VALUES field.  The default
	value is True, which means to do caching.	
	* src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/orca.py: start keeping better
	tracking of CORBA COMM FAILURES; throw a11y.InvalidObjectError
	exceptions and set the "valid" field of the Accessible to False
	when these errors are detected.
	
2005-08-08  Maxim Dziumanenko <mvd@mylinux.ua>

        * configure.in: Added "uk" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-08-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braillegenerator.py: work on verbosity
	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/speech.py,
	src/orca/default.py: work on verbosity.  Move speechgenerator to 
	a list of utterances rather than a single string containing
	multiple sentences; this avoids spurious punctuation being sent
	to the synthesis engine.

2005-08-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py: uncache label on name or description change
	* src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
	src/orca/braillegenerator.py: add ability to speak tree node level
	* src/orca/braille.py: add return to home functionality for when
	the user presses CMD_HOME.
	* src/orca/default.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
	src/orca/braillegenerator.py: do some work on speech and braille
	for tables.

2005-08-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py: try not to speak fillers.
	* src/orca/default.py: handle issue where parents that manage 
	descendants will potentially give a unique accessible instance
	for the same child each time getChildAtIndex is called.
	* src/orca/default.py: use selection changed events on specific
	roles to update the locus of focus.
	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py: remove the speaking of unavailable
	if the object is an icon.  
	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py._getSpeechForAlert: when presenting
	a dialog, do not grab "free" labels that are children of a push
	button.
	* src/orca/a11y.py.__get_label: obtain the names of push buttons
	a little better; push buttons can have labels as children and
	can also be labelled by something.
	* src/orca/default.py.onNameChanged: ignore name changes
	on dialogs that have focus for now; the motivator for this is that
	gnome-terminal appears to issue name change events on the
	"Edit" -> "Current Profile..."  dialog even though the name didn't
	change.
	
2005-07-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speech.py: add recovery from failure to register speech
	callback with FreeTTS driver on Fedora (it works fine on
	JDS/Suse).  Not quite sure what is going on here, but something
	deep in the bowels of CORBA is croaking.
	
2005-07-29  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py: better handling of menu and focus events
	for setting the locusOfFocus.
	
	* src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/orca.py: add speech rate
	increase/decrease functionality (still needs work to make
	sure it doesn't go out of parameter bounds).
	* src/orca/braillegenerator.py: style guide work for menus.
	
2005-07-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* a11y.py, braille.py, debug.py, default.py,
	focus_tracking_presenter.py, hierarchical_presenter.py, metacity.py,
	orca.py, script.py, speechgenerator.py: begin developing the
	notion of locus of focus and visual appearance change.

2005-07-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py: add ability to treat the insert key as a
	modifier.  Use insert+F1 to enter learn mode.
	* src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/default.py,
	src/orca/speechgenerator.py: fix some speech generator issues with
	toggle buttons as well as verbosity (accidentally told the
	generators to speak too little).

2005-07-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py,
	src/orca/rolenames.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py,
	src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/settings.py: add speech and
	braille generator concepts; also do a very rough (and poor) pass
	at trying to implement the output style guidelines.

	* src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/orca.in: move signal handling to
	orca.in.
	
2005-06-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/default.py,
	src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
	src/orca/hierarchical_presenter.py, src/orca/input_event.py,
	src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/script.py, src/orca/settings.py: add
	learn mode.
	
2005-06-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py: Register a signal handler for ctrl-C.
	
2005-06-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py,
	src/orca/script.py: rough pass at allowing user defined
	keybindings to override key bindings in scripts.
	* TODO: update to include issues with autogen.
	
2005-06-23  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/*: bite the bullet and make scripts full-fledged
	classes.  This allow scripts to better maintain state across
	activations of the same window, and to allow for more unique
	scripts when running the same application more than once.
	
2005-06-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/*: put Orca in its own "orca" package to avoid
	cluttering the default python namespace.
	
2005-06-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/*.py: incorporate prototype Braille support.
	
2005-06-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/brl/brlmodule.c,src/orca/*.py: prepare to move Braille
	region logic into Python.  The brlmodule.c will then serve
	as an interface to BrlTTY.
	
2005-06-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/debug.py,src/orca/default.py,src/orca/orca/py: begin
	bringing Braille input back to life.
	* src/orca/*.py: try to follow the public/private naming
	convention (i.e., use "_" prefix for private fields) more.
	* src/orca/script.py: renamed "mod"-related fields to "custom"
	because I kept getting confused.
	* src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,src/orca/orca.py,
	src/orca/script.py,src/orca/gaim.py: only reload a script
	when a window is activated (the current implementation was
	reloading a script for every event received).
	
2005-06-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py: don't set object's parent attribute if it has
	not been defined yet; instead just return None from __getattr__.
	* src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: get rid of 
	"ERROR: app not found" message.
	* src/orca/debug.py: reformatting of event output.
	* src/orca/orca.py,hierarchical_presenter.py: add simple code to
	draw outlines around an accessible.  This has the impact of now
	requiring the DISPLAY to be set before running Orca.
	
2005-06-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py: make processKeyEvent a little (maybe not a
	lot) smarter about handling control characters.
	
2005-06-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py,debug.py: add the ability to filter event
	output based on a regular expression.  This is for debug purposes
	only.  The next step is to enable a keystroke in Orca to allow
	the filter to be set/reset to allow for specific event tracking.
	* src/orca/*.py: add notion of a "presentation manager" to allow
	for presentation managers such as "focus tracking", "flat review"
	and "hierarchical".  Split the current presentation code out from
	orca.py into focus_tracking_presenter.py.  Also created new (and
	very experimental) hierarchical_presenter.py to allow for some
	detailed exploration of the at-spi component hierarchy.	
	
2005-04-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/*.py: anal-retentive refactoring and surface level
	formatting of code.

2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py: attempt at comboBoxPresenter.

2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py: fix bug in the way state_change_notifiers
	were handled (list with one item was being exploded into
	individual characters, which is not what we want), improve page
	tab presenter, update text presenter.
	* src/orca/gnome-terminal.py: remove the text event handlers
	because they were identical to default.py.
	
2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/debug.py: allow debugLevel to be set/used on the fly
	rather than the somewhat static way it was being done.  The
	way to use it now is to "import debug" in settings.py (or anywhere
	else) and then do "debug.setDebugLevel(debug.LEVEL_CONFIGURATION)"
	somewhere else.
	* src/orca/speech.py: more gracefully recover from failures
	if/when the speech service dies.  Right now, on any failure, the
	speech module will reset and reconnect to the speech server 
	rather than just groaning about a COMM_FAILURE.
	
2005-04-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py: add an attempt at getting the group
	* src/orca/rolenames.py: sync up with ATK rolenames
	* src/orca/speech.py: capture CORBA failures for now
	* src/orca/default.py: passes at defaultPresenter,
	pushButtonPresenter, toggleButtonPresenter, radioButtonPresenter,
	menuBarPresenter, menuPresenter, and sliderPresenter.
	* docs/programmers-guide/programmers-guide.{sgml,pdf}: some 
	level of introduction to style.  Still much work to do when it
	comes to notions of levels of verbosity and speaker style.
	
2005-04-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/{a11y.py, debug.py, default.py, kbd.py, metacity,py,
	orca.py, rolenames.py, speech.py}: finer grained control over
	debugging.  Debugging is now set by a numerical value rather than
	a boolean.  See debug.py for the different levels.  To turn
	debugging on, set "debugLevel = 500" (or some appropriate number)
	in settings.py.  For backwards compatibility, "debug = True" in
	this file will default to debug.LEVEL_FINER.

2005-04-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am: add debug.py to orca_python_PYTHON

2005-04-01  Steve Murphy  <murf@e-tools.com>

        * configure.in: Added "rw" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-04-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* default-keybindings.ppy, default.py, speech.py: add sayAgain
	support to repeat last utterance spoken
	* default.py: more work to be in line with gnopernicus
	* rolenames.py: import text for speech and Braille from gnopernicus
	* speech.py: interrupt speech when given something new to say
	* mag.py: a little better (but far from perfect) way to move ROI
	to match object with focus; also add support for tracking mouse events
	
2005-03-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* gnome-terminal.py:  call default.brlUpdateText
	* a11y.py: add capability to get component extents from 
	an accessible
	* orca.py, default.py: add beginnings of magnification support
	* mag.py: early magnification support
	
2005-03-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Upgrade to brltty-3.6.1 (TODO: perhaps add backwards
	compatibility in if people complain.).
	* Add *.pyc (compiled *.py files) to src/orca/.cvsignore.
	* Use try/except blocks more sparingly to allow for easier
	debugging.  Also add more debugging features to debug.py.
	A quite note on debugging: add "debug = True" to 
	~/.orca/settings.py to turn debugging on.
	* Fix presentation of radio and checkbox menu items.
	* Make menus speak like Gnopernicus for now.
	* Backout a11y.py workaround for Nautilus shortcomings; it turns
	out this workaround was hurting the overall logic.
	
2005-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Remove src/orca/dispatcher.py as it was obsoleted by the
	  dispathcher table in a11y.py.

2005-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Nearly every source file: added much documentation and many
	  TODO comments.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py (init): remove call to core.init() as this
	is done in a11y.init().  The dual call was causing orca to crash.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speech.py (init): add extra parameters to call to
	bonobo.activation.activate_from_id as a result of change to
	gnome-python on 2004-12-13.

2005-02-03  Alessio Frusciante  <algol@firenze.linux.it>

	* configure.in: Added "it" (Italian) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-01-17	Amanpreet Singh Alam <amanpreetalam@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: Added "sr" and "sr@Latn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-09-09  Ankit Patel <ankit@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Added 'gu' (Gujarati) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-08-27  Marc Mulcahy  <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py (init): Display an error message and exit if
	the registry can't be activated (i.E. the Orca core can't be
	initialized)

	* src/core/coremodule.c (core_module_init): Fix return values on
	exception.

2004-08-21  Francisco Javier F. Serrador  <serrador@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "es" (Spanish) translation.

2004-07-14  Marc Mulcahy  <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py (Accessible.__del__): The unref might throw a
	CORBA_COMM_FAILURE if the object has died.

2004-07-02  Hendrik Brandt  <hebra@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "de" (German) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-30    <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py (Accessible.__get_relations): New
	implementation which makes sure relations are narrowed to make
	sure things work right with Java.
	(Accessible.__get_app): Get app also fails if the thing it finds
	is not an application.
	(onWindowActivated): Make sure focussedAp is narrowed so it works
	right with Java.
	(onFocus): Since we're tracking the active application, objects
	which get focus get their app attribute set to the active
	application-- this hack is needed for Nautilus.
	(getLabel): Ensure the target that we get from a relation is an
	accessible wrapper.

	* src/orca/Gecko.py (presentNextHypertext): Fixed to use new
	accessible wrapper.
	(onFocus): Fixed to use new accessible wrapper.

	* src/orca/orca.in: Don't speak "selcome to Orca" here-- now
	spoken in orca.py in start.

2004-06-28  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@redfoxcenter.org>

	* configure.in: Added "fr" (French) to ALL_LINGUAS.

	events through one function which decides which script should
	receive each event.

	* src/orca/default.py: UPdated to use new accesible wrappers.

	* src/orca/a11y.py: Added an accessible wrapper in pythohn. MOved
	all the listeners which update the object caches to a11y.py.

	* src/core/eventlistener.c: Don't include pyaccessible.h.

	* src/core/pyevent.c: The pyevent no longer includes a
	pyaccessible as the source -- it includes a pycorba_object.
	(pyevent_dealloc): Free the any_data.
	(pyevent_get_source): The source is now a pycora_object rather
	than a pyaccessible.

	* src/core/coremodule.c: Removed pyaccessible stuff including all
	the event handlers which refresh the cache.

	* Removed src/core/pyaccessible.c and src/core/pyaccessible.h --
	the accessible wrappers are now written in PYthon in
	src/orca/a11y.py.
