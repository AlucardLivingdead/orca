2005-08-04  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/braillegenerator.py: work on verbosity
	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/speech.py,
	src/orca/default.py: work on verbosity.  Move speechgenerator to 
	a list of utterances rather than a single string containing
	multiple sentences; this avoids spurious punctuation being sent
	to the synthesis engine.
	
2005-08-02  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py: uncache label on name or description change
	* src/orca/a11y.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
	src/orca/braillegenerator.py: add ability to speak tree node level
	* src/orca/braille.py: add return to home functionality for when
	the user presses CMD_HOME.
	* src/orca/default.py, src/orca/speechgenerator.py,
	src/orca/braillegenerator.py: do some work on speech and braille
	for tables.

2005-08-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py: try not to speak fillers.
	* src/orca/default.py: handle issue where parents that manage 
	descendants will potentially give a unique accessible instance
	for the same child each time getChildAtIndex is called.
	* src/orca/default.py: use selection changed events on specific
	roles to update the locus of focus.
	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py: remove the speaking of unavailable
	if the object is an icon.  
	* src/orca/speechgenerator.py._getSpeechForAlert: when presenting
	a dialog, do not grab "free" labels that are children of a push
	button.
	* src/orca/a11y.py.__get_label: obtain the names of push buttons
	a little better; push buttons can have labels as children and
	can also be labelled by something.
	* src/orca/default.py.onNameChanged: ignore name changes
	on dialogs that have focus for now; the motivator for this is that
	gnome-terminal appears to issue name change events on the
	"Edit" -> "Current Profile..."  dialog even though the name didn't
	change.
	
2005-07-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speech.py: add recovery from failure to register speech
	callback with FreeTTS driver on Fedora (it works fine on
	JDS/Suse).  Not quite sure what is going on here, but something
	deep in the bowels of CORBA is croaking.
	
2005-07-29  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py: better handling of menu and focus events
	for setting the locusOfFocus.
	
	* src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/orca.py: add speech rate
	increase/decrease functionality (still needs work to make
	sure it doesn't go out of parameter bounds).
	* src/orca/braillegenerator.py: style guide work for menus.
	
2005-07-26  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* a11y.py, braille.py, debug.py, default.py,
	focus_tracking_presenter.py, hierarchical_presenter.py, metacity.py,
	orca.py, script.py, speechgenerator.py: begin developing the
	notion of locus of focus and visual appearance change.

2005-07-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py: add ability to treat the insert key as a
	modifier.  Use insert+F1 to enter learn mode.
	* src/orca/speech.py, src/orca/default.py,
	src/orca/speechgenerator.py: fix some speech generator issues with
	toggle buttons as well as verbosity (accidentally told the
	generators to speak too little).

2005-07-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/default.py,
	src/orca/rolenames.py, src/orca/braillegenerator.py,
	src/orca/speechgenerator.py, src/orca/settings.py: add speech and
	braille generator concepts; also do a very rough (and poor) pass
	at trying to implement the output style guidelines.

	* src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/orca.in: move signal handling to
	orca.in.
	
2005-06-30  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am, src/orca/default.py,
	src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,
	src/orca/hierarchical_presenter.py, src/orca/input_event.py,
	src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/script.py, src/orca/settings.py: add
	learn mode.
	
2005-06-27  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py: Register a signal handler for ctrl-C.
	
2005-06-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py, src/orca/orca.py, src/orca/settings.py,
	src/orca/script.py: rough pass at allowing user defined
	keybindings to override key bindings in scripts.
	* TODO: update to include issues with autogen.
	
2005-06-23  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/*: bite the bullet and make scripts full-fledged
	classes.  This allow scripts to better maintain state across
	activations of the same window, and to allow for more unique
	scripts when running the same application more than once.
	
2005-06-22  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/*: put Orca in its own "orca" package to avoid
	cluttering the default python namespace.
	
2005-06-21  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/*.py: incorporate prototype Braille support.
	
2005-06-17  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/brl/brlmodule.c,src/orca/*.py: prepare to move Braille
	region logic into Python.  The brlmodule.c will then serve
	as an interface to BrlTTY.
	
2005-06-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/debug.py,src/orca/default.py,src/orca/orca/py: begin
	bringing Braille input back to life.
	* src/orca/*.py: try to follow the public/private naming
	convention (i.e., use "_" prefix for private fields) more.
	* src/orca/script.py: renamed "mod"-related fields to "custom"
	because I kept getting confused.
	* src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py,src/orca/orca.py,
	src/orca/script.py,src/orca/gaim.py: only reload a script
	when a window is activated (the current implementation was
	reloading a script for every event received).
	
2005-06-14  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py: don't set object's parent attribute if it has
	not been defined yet; instead just return None from __getattr__.
	* src/orca/focus_tracking_presenter.py: get rid of 
	"ERROR: app not found" message.
	* src/orca/debug.py: reformatting of event output.
	* src/orca/orca.py,hierarchical_presenter.py: add simple code to
	draw outlines around an accessible.  This has the impact of now
	requiring the DISPLAY to be set before running Orca.
	
2005-06-13  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py: make processKeyEvent a little (maybe not a
	lot) smarter about handling control characters.
	
2005-06-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py,debug.py: add the ability to filter event
	output based on a regular expression.  This is for debug purposes
	only.  The next step is to enable a keystroke in Orca to allow
	the filter to be set/reset to allow for specific event tracking.
	* src/orca/*.py: add notion of a "presentation manager" to allow
	for presentation managers such as "focus tracking", "flat review"
	and "hierarchical".  Split the current presentation code out from
	orca.py into focus_tracking_presenter.py.  Also created new (and
	very experimental) hierarchical_presenter.py to allow for some
	detailed exploration of the at-spi component hierarchy.	
	
2005-04-24  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/*.py: anal-retentive refactoring and surface level
	formatting of code.

2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py: attempt at comboBoxPresenter.

2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/default.py: fix bug in the way state_change_notifiers
	were handled (list with one item was being exploded into
	individual characters, which is not what we want), improve page
	tab presenter, update text presenter.
	* src/orca/gnome-terminal.py: remove the text event handlers
	because they were identical to default.py.
	
2005-04-19  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/debug.py: allow debugLevel to be set/used on the fly
	rather than the somewhat static way it was being done.  The
	way to use it now is to "import debug" in settings.py (or anywhere
	else) and then do "debug.setDebugLevel(debug.LEVEL_CONFIGURATION)"
	somewhere else.
	* src/orca/speech.py: more gracefully recover from failures
	if/when the speech service dies.  Right now, on any failure, the
	speech module will reset and reconnect to the speech server 
	rather than just groaning about a COMM_FAILURE.
	
2005-04-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py: add an attempt at getting the group
	* src/orca/rolenames.py: sync up with ATK rolenames
	* src/orca/speech.py: capture CORBA failures for now
	* src/orca/default.py: passes at defaultPresenter,
	pushButtonPresenter, toggleButtonPresenter, radioButtonPresenter,
	menuBarPresenter, menuPresenter, and sliderPresenter.
	* docs/programmers-guide/programmers-guide.{sgml,pdf}: some 
	level of introduction to style.  Still much work to do when it
	comes to notions of levels of verbosity and speaker style.
	
2005-04-08  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/{a11y.py, debug.py, default.py, kbd.py, metacity,py,
	orca.py, rolenames.py, speech.py}: finer grained control over
	debugging.  Debugging is now set by a numerical value rather than
	a boolean.  See debug.py for the different levels.  To turn
	debugging on, set "debugLevel = 500" (or some appropriate number)
	in settings.py.  For backwards compatibility, "debug = True" in
	this file will default to debug.LEVEL_FINER.

2005-04-05  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/Makefile.am: add debug.py to orca_python_PYTHON

2005-04-01  Steve Murphy  <murf@e-tools.com>

        * configure.in: Added "rw" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-04-01  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* default-keybindings.ppy, default.py, speech.py: add sayAgain
	support to repeat last utterance spoken
	* default.py: more work to be in line with gnopernicus
	* rolenames.py: import text for speech and Braille from gnopernicus
	* speech.py: interrupt speech when given something new to say
	* mag.py: a little better (but far from perfect) way to move ROI
	to match object with focus; also add support for tracking mouse events
	
2005-03-31  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* gnome-terminal.py:  call default.brlUpdateText
	* a11y.py: add capability to get component extents from 
	an accessible
	* orca.py, default.py: add beginnings of magnification support
	* mag.py: early magnification support
	
2005-03-25  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Upgrade to brltty-3.6.1 (TODO: perhaps add backwards
	compatibility in if people complain.).
	* Add *.pyc (compiled *.py files) to src/orca/.cvsignore.
	* Use try/except blocks more sparingly to allow for easier
	debugging.  Also add more debugging features to debug.py.
	A quite note on debugging: add "debug = True" to 
	~/.orca/settings.py to turn debugging on.
	* Fix presentation of radio and checkbox menu items.
	* Make menus speak like Gnopernicus for now.
	* Backout a11y.py workaround for Nautilus shortcomings; it turns
	out this workaround was hurting the overall logic.
	
2005-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Remove src/orca/dispatcher.py as it was obsoleted by the
	  dispathcher table in a11y.py.

2005-02-15  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* Nearly every source file: added much documentation and many
	  TODO comments.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py (init): remove call to core.init() as this
	is done in a11y.init().  The dual call was causing orca to crash.

2005-02-10  Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com>

	* src/orca/speech.py (init): add extra parameters to call to
	bonobo.activation.activate_from_id as a result of change to
	gnome-python on 2004-12-13.

2005-02-03  Alessio Frusciante  <algol@firenze.linux.it>

	* configure.in: Added "it" (Italian) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-01-17	Amanpreet Singh Alam <amanpreetalam@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: "pa" is Added to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-10-16  Danilo Šegan  <dsegan@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Added "sr" and "sr@Latn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-09-09  Ankit Patel <ankit@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Added 'gu' (Gujarati) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-08-27  Marc Mulcahy  <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

	* src/orca/orca.py (init): Display an error message and exit if
	the registry can't be activated (i.E. the Orca core can't be
	initialized)

	* src/core/coremodule.c (core_module_init): Fix return values on
	exception.

2004-08-21  Francisco Javier F. Serrador  <serrador@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "es" (Spanish) translation.

2004-07-14  Marc Mulcahy  <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py (Accessible.__del__): The unref might throw a
	CORBA_COMM_FAILURE if the object has died.

2004-07-02  Hendrik Brandt  <hebra@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "de" (German) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-30    <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

	* src/orca/a11y.py (Accessible.__get_relations): New
	implementation which makes sure relations are narrowed to make
	sure things work right with Java.
	(Accessible.__get_app): Get app also fails if the thing it finds
	is not an application.
	(onWindowActivated): Make sure focussedAp is narrowed so it works
	right with Java.
	(onFocus): Since we're tracking the active application, objects
	which get focus get their app attribute set to the active
	application-- this hack is needed for Nautilus.
	(getLabel): Ensure the target that we get from a relation is an
	accessible wrapper.

	* src/orca/Gecko.py (presentNextHypertext): Fixed to use new
	accessible wrapper.
	(onFocus): Fixed to use new accessible wrapper.

	* src/orca/orca.in: Don't speak "selcome to Orca" here-- now
	spoken in orca.py in start.

2004-06-28  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@redfoxcenter.org>

	* configure.in: Added "fr" (French) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-25    <marc.mulcahy@sun.com>

	activating keybinding sets and brlKey handlers.

	* src/orca/rolenames.py (getRoleName): Use new accessible wrapper.

	* src/orca/orca.py (init): Register event listeners for tracking
	window activation/deactivation for activating/deactivating
	scripts.
	(processEvent): Changed event processing to filter all at-spi
	events through one function which decides which script should
	receive each event.

	* src/orca/default.py: UPdated to use new accesible wrappers.

	* src/orca/a11y.py: Added an accessible wrapper in pythohn. MOved
	all the listeners which update the object caches to a11y.py.

	* src/core/eventlistener.c: Don't include pyaccessible.h.

	* src/core/pyevent.c: The pyevent no longer includes a
	pyaccessible as the source -- it includes a pycorba_object.
	(pyevent_dealloc): Free the any_data.
	(pyevent_get_source): The source is now a pycora_object rather
	than a pyaccessible.

	* src/core/coremodule.c: Removed pyaccessible stuff including all
	the event handlers which refresh the cache.

	* Removed src/core/pyaccessible.c and src/core/pyaccessible.h --
	the accessible wrappers are now written in PYthon in
	src/orca/a11y.py.

	* src/orca/Makefile.am (orca_python_PYTHON): Add a default
	settings file.

	* src/orca/speech.py (init): If the settings file does not specify
	any voices, as is the case for the default settings file, then
	select the first voice of the first driver as the default.

	returning NULL when the brlapi library can't be found, or any
	functions within brlapi can't be found.

	Change version number to 0.0.13.
	Generate spec file.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added spec file to the distribution.

	* NEWS: Updated.

	* orca.spec.in: Checked spec file into cvs.

	* src/orca/orca.in: Remove path fiddling which is broken when
